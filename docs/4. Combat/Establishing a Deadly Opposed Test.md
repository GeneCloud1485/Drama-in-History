# **Establishing Momentum**

Momentum tracks the ebb and flow of the upper hand in a conflict. Whoever has momentum will win ties in opposed rolls.

-   Opposed rolls testing current **Grit** + contextual situations + advantages to establish momentum
-   Highest has momentum
-   Ties resolved by the highest A or contextual situation

Momentum is passed to the winner in a round of opposed rolls, unless a specific action or risk is taken to 'grab' momentum.

The loser declares their pool decisions first = use of Military Life, split of pools and/or use of Advantages. This provides the winner the chance to adjust their strategy based on the slower person's choices.

# Director's Advice



## Fortitude Loss
- Balancing the risk of the tests - regardless of the person's fortitude pool size, the threat is based on the number of Rd rolled.
- The Rd is based on the threat level and any current penalties
- You could calculate the inherent threat of a story based on the number and size of the threats at ~33% per Rd being a loss of Fortitude.
- Failing tests will add penalty dice, which could accelerate the risk. 
- But penalty dice can be generally be recovered with rest and recuperation. Unless the story has time pressure the actors can probably balance their own risks
> e.g. if there are three shocking moments each at 2Rd, there is fair chance that each actor will lose two fortitude as a result. This is unlikely to knock them out, or even push them to a persistent penalty, but will require a couple of months recovery.

- Pushing buttons to focus on 'struggle' could easily lead to higher Fort risks



## The Three Dimensions of Non Player Actors
Each non-player actor should be classified by their current importance in the story. 

#### One Dimensional Cast & Cameos
Cast or Cameo actors will tend to be one dimensional, and only need limited preparation. Along with the basics of who they are, they should have one personality trait, and one memorable moment prepared. This should provide enough for them to play their part as a supporting character, if they get more spot light or focus they should be upgraded to Supporting Actors with more depth and personality.

- One personality trait
- One story or memorable moment

## Scenes
> Robert McKee defines “A scene is a story in miniature…no matter locations or length, a scene is unified around **desire, action, conflict, and change.**”

It can be broken down and prepared as follows;

1. **Scene**: The Context & Goals
	- Setting, NPC and current situation
	* Description
	* Purpose
1. **Actors**: NPC, Resources
	* NPC
	* Resources
1. **Drama**: Conflict & Challenge & Risk
    *...Create conflict to; advance plot, reveal character, create emotion & change, provide challenge and what is at risk?*
    * NPC goals & desires lead to action & conflict
	* Timer & Threat
	* Drama - create, develop or reveal something meaningful about someone
	* Intrigue
	* Challenge & Struggle
	* Risks
1. **Action**: Possible Resolutions or Actions or Choices
	* Consider some of the possible courses of action and resolutions
	* Choices, and tough choices to make
1. **Outcome**; Rewards and Change
	* How are the players changed by scenes with this NPC? 
	* Will they have learnt useful, interesting or engaging story? 
	* Is achieving the goal going to unlock something meaningful for the players?
	* How will the NPC change if they achieve their goal or don't achieve their goal?
	* Direction, what next?
	* Foreshadowing

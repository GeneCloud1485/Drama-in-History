# Director's Advice



## Fortitude
- Balancing the risk of the tests - regardless of the person's fortitude pool size, the threat is based on the number of Rd rolled.
- The Rd is based on the threat level and any current penalties
- You could calculate the inherent threat of a story based on the number and size of the threats at ~33% per Rd being a loss of Fortitude.
- Failing tests will add penalty dice, which could accelerate the risk. 
- But penalty dice can be generally be recovered with rest and recuperation. Unless the story has time pressure the actors can probably balance their own risks
> e.g. if there are three shocking moments each at 2Rd, there is fair chance that each actor will lose two fortitude as a result. This is unlikely to knock them out, or even push them to a persistent penalty, but will require a couple of months recovery.

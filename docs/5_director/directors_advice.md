# Director's Advice


# Seasons
A season covers a larger story or perhaps a number of smaller, connected stories which end at a logical point allowing the Actor's to pause for breath and reflect on the chronicle of their lives.

At the end of each season the actor can recover their Drama Points back to their current maximum level. Recovery can 


# The Turning of the Year
Depending on the setting and the cadence of your game's Seasons, the Turning of the Year could align with the end of the calendar year, or it could just represent a period of 'down time'. It helps to be broadly consistent and have a 12 month period between your Turning of the Year scenes.

During the Turning of the Year each Actor reflects on their story, shines a light on their family, business or more mundane activities.
- Advancement
- Family
- Vignettes 





## Fortitude Loss
- Balancing the risk of the tests - regardless of the person's fortitude pool size, the threat is based on the number of Rd rolled.
- The Rd is based on the threat level and any current penalties
- You could calculate the inherent threat of a story based on the number and size of the threats at ~33% per Rd being a loss of Fortitude.
- Failing tests will add penalty dice, which could accelerate the risk. 
- But penalty dice can be generally be recovered with rest and recuperation. Unless the story has time pressure the actors can probably balance their own risks
> e.g. if there are three shocking moments each at 2Rd, there is fair chance that each actor will lose two fortitude as a result. This is unlikely to knock them out, or even push them to a persistent penalty, but will require a couple of months recovery.

- Pushing buttons to focus on 'struggle' could easily lead to higher Fort risks



## The Three Dimensions of Non Player Actors
Each non-player actor should be classified by their current importance in the story. 

#### One Dimensional Cast & Cameos
Cast or Cameo actors will tend to be one dimensional, and only need limited preparation. Along with the basics of who they are, they should have one personality trait, and one memorable moment prepared. This should provide enough for them to play their part as a supporting character, if they get more spot light or focus they should be upgraded to Supporting Actors with more depth and personality.
- Basic description
- One personality trait
- One story or memorable moment

#### Two Dimensional Supporting Actors


#### Three Dimensional Actors & above
- Traits
- Spine
- 1+ Fact
- Personality & Action verbs
- Mannerisms & Performance
- Description
- Bonds & Beliefs



## Scenes
> Robert McKee defines “A scene is a story in miniature…no matter locations or length, a scene is unified around **desire, action, conflict, and change.**”

It can be broken down and prepared as follows;

1. **Scene**: The Context & Goals
	- Setting, NPC and current situation
	* Description
	* Purpose
1. **Actors**: NPC, Resources
	* NPC
	* Resources
1. **Drama**: Conflict & Challenge & Risk
    *...Create conflict to; advance plot, reveal character, create emotion & change, provide challenge and what is at risk?*
    * NPC goals & desires lead to action & conflict
	* Timer & Threat
	* Drama - create, develop or reveal something meaningful about someone
	* Intrigue
	* Challenge & Struggle
	* Risks
1. **Action**: Possible Resolutions or Actions or Choices
	* Consider some of the possible courses of action and resolutions
	* Choices, and tough choices to make
1. **Outcome**; Rewards and Change
	* How are the players changed by scenes with this NPC? 
	* Will they have learnt useful, interesting or engaging story? 
	* Is achieving the goal going to unlock something meaningful for the players?
	* How will the NPC change if they achieve their goal or don't achieve their goal?
	* Direction, what next?
	* Foreshadowing


## Stories

#### Questions
Questions are mysteries which drive the player to find answers, they create interest, surprise, delight and a sense of accomplishment on completion.

- Questions that 'demand' to be answered
	- Find ways to have questions in the player's minds
	- Questions need answers
	- Seeking answers drives player action and engagement
- Questions can be created by the Director as part of the story
- Or be part of the setting & context
- Or be seeded by NPCs
- Or be a hook for a new story 

- Answers indicate closure and resolution
- They mark achievements and celebrate the player's progress and completion.

## Season Arcs



## Vignette Scenes
> Vignette  "A brief evocative description, account, or episode"

In game terms a vignette can take many forms, generally used as a stand-alone scene with focus on a dramatic moment

## Foreshadowing

## Challenge & Struggle

## Running investigations
- Can this be treated like a complex challenge?

# Non Player Actor Tracking
- Storage
- Reference
- 1 - 3D


# Creating Sandboxes
- Developed setting
- All about the people
	- A few with goals and plans
	- Which the players can tangle with
	- but which can change and evolve as the players get involved
- Which creates situations
- And scenes and hard struggle choices
- Ready to evolve with player emphasis


Story/plot design -> asking questions which can be answered by progression
2 + 2 = ... let the players work through the answer and don't tell them that the answer is 4


Spine is the life goal  
People are contradictory
Dramatic transformation- a guide to npc development over time. Not an immediate guide to their personalities


Describe don’t explain  -> there is fine line to be walked, if players don't understand the cues or clues you are sharing the game may be derailed or mixed up. Allowing players to work it out for themselves from the cue and acting you provide, will be more engaging and feel better.
2+2 = 4

Self conscious concerns about being the npc  
  

  


Listen to players. Respond to their cues and listen. Show you are listening.  
Leads to being generous or improv opportunities 


1. One to Three action verbs to use in an NPCs personality - they can be used in one scene, or consistent in every scene. 1D to 3D determines how many action verbs an actor needs. The more the more nuanced a performance, but the more challenging for the Director to play and recall scene after scene. The action verbs can be chosen to fit the scene, again the more variations then less clear and consistent the NPC will be to the players. Some simplification or characterization can help an NPC be consistent and come alive. The repetition is likely to be more noticeable to the Director than the actors.
	1. to... do something to the players
2. A fact about the NPC actor which will influence their thinking, approach and style. This fact does not always need to be something that the player actors know about or learn. It is something which provides insight into the personality of the actor.
	1. A secret or event in the actor's past, or possibly an outcome in the future which is destined to happen.
	2. A story from their past, or a story that they will tell
	3. Information that they can draw upon
	4. Something which helps inform you about their character
3. Define their spine, what one trait or idea defines this person. Something substantial, that spans their life and helps determine who they are

**Film acting is, in large part, reacting and listening** - Michael Caine
- be present!

Talk to the mic like a person



Aristotle said that the struggle of the individual to win as the essence of all drama.

Your pure concentration on accomplishing a goal makes you unaware of what you look like, and allows your naturally distinctive mannerisms and quirks to come forward

Use of memorable 'spectacle' (Aristotle's drama) - impactful scenes or moments, powerful characterization or remarkable moments, choices or characters.

Stories should have a theme that give players something to recognize and feel part of. Another opportunity for 2+2 rather than 4 (giving players the pieces that they can connect and feel smart rather than telling the answers)

How will a story be remarkable? something which the players/actors will remember, talk about and recount to friends later. Remarkable could be something spectacular or over the top, but is much more likely to be a result of player agency, involvement and tough or dramatic choices. 

We have become desensitized to the impact of big 'action' scenes, but we are always engaged by people's emotional & dramatic stories.

# Connections & Clues
A 'connection' is a point of understanding in the Story, an insight the players need, a scene with a person or location, and a connective idea between scenes. They make up the fabric of the [[1.0_concepts#Seasons, Stories & Scenes|Story]] and the relationship between information. For players to understand the story or mystery they will need to make the necessary connections. Most connections will be made through clues, some will be made by player instinct or deduction or assumption.

> E.g. Brother Renard is possessed


Clues should support one or more Connection.

# Premise
A story’s premise is the foundational idea that expresses the plot in simple terms. A good premise will communicate your story’s essence in a one-sentence or two-sentence statement.
[TODO provide examples...]

- Not player facing
- Director guidance
- Help bring focus, consistent and emphasis to a story

> E.g. Croyland - question of what you believe, and how much you will risk for what you believe



## Soaps
- Cast of characters
- With regular stories and changing relationships and perpetual drama
- Yet nothing really changes
- Cast left with unfulfilled relationship goals

"So then, the term “soap opera” might be better referred to as “longform drama” or “longform dramatic narrative”. It is a style of narrative that is not only designed to span chronologically over long breadths of time, but also to delve deeply into each character’s story arcs and growth, and it is a style of narrative designed to constantly engage the viewer with new developments that will not immediately be resolved."

1. _**Create a fixed community**_
   ...soaps revolve around fixed communities caught up in melodramatic story lines. Creating a fixed community allows an audience to become fully invested in characters that may range from all ages but will all center around a center point.
2.  _**Perpetual drama**_
   ...the drama never stops in a soap- there is never a time where the characters aren’t involved in some sort of predicament.
3. _**Use of events**_
   ...Unexpected tragedies, revelations and general mayhem occur with frequency at weddings, births, funerals, christenings, anniversaries and other major life events in a soap. Soap opera writers use life events to reveal plot points or to stir up further crises, but the use of dramatic happenings at an event where most characters in the fixed community are gathered is found in almost every soap opera.
4. _**Make the bizarre believable**_
   ...Soap opera audiences rarely analyze the absurdity of the scenario soap characters are in if the soap opera creator has done their job in making the bizarre believable.
5. _**Controversial topics**_
   ...Of course, a soap opera writer needs to treat these topics with dignity and sensitivity. Thorough research is required for deeper topics. Still, don’t be afraid to use these controversial topics in a story line because they are usually what keeps an audience interested and wanting to know the outcome.
6. _**Cliff hangers**_
   ...Leaving a plot in suspense is what keeps soap opera lovers coming back for more! It also allows the soap opera writer to shift onto another topic before getting back to the cliff hanger.
7. _**Wild imagination**_
   ...A soap opera writer should never stop dreaming up absurdities, calamities, romance, melodrama- it is the one genre in which even fantasy elements can be added.

# Introduction to the underlying concept

[Back to the Index](/index.md)

## Seasons, Stories & Scenes
Passage of time is an important aspect of the game, it helps to bring context, connection and believability to the characters and their world. Establishing families, building relationships with people over a period of years and exploring the drama in passing history. To help give a framework to the game’s year, it is split into 2 game **Seasons**; Spring & Summer (Easter to Michaelmas), Autumn & Winter (Michaelmas to Easter). 

The Spring & Summer season is the time for Stories, which is where the camera lingers on the drama as it plays out. The seasons of Autumn & Winter are condensed into opportunities for family, chronicle or campaign scenes. 

**Stories** contain the situations, ‘scenarios’ or ‘adventures’ that player are involved in. They are tend to be made up of a number of **Scenes.**

A **Scene** is way to think about a chunk of playable time, sometimes these are part of a longer Story and other times, especially in the Autumn & Winter seasons they can be condensed scenes to bring focus on a single situation or decision.

Minutes & Moments… [TODO]

Most scenes are not time critical and can be run without concern of timekeeping. A few scenes will need more granular management, combat being a good example. In this context, scenes are broken into minutes and further broken into moments. Ten moments are considered to be a minute, and this provides a basic framework for reference more than a tactical second by second tracker.

# Underlying Mechanics: Building a Dice Pool
Rolling a pool of dice is used to test and resolve situations, conflicts or challenges. The pool is generated by bringing in a number of dice to reflect the underlying skill, additional advantages or risks being taken, or penalties for persistent status or situational modifiers. Different dice are used depending on the skill, advantage or penalty being applied to the pool. 

## General Guide to Building a Pool
#### 1. Base pool = Attribute + Skill
1. Take the appropriate underlying attribute
2. Add a single directly appropriate skill
3. If not appropriate skill then take an appropriate background experience
	1. [TODO] simplify the calculation of backgrounds into dice

#### 2. Situational pool = modifiers + resistance
1. How hard is the test? add resistance penalty dice nPd
2. Any modifiers due to circumstance either nBd or nPd or both
   (note: don't cancel or net off applied dice, add them both into the pool)
3. Any important personality modifiers - scars, strengths, traits or bonds
4. Plus any persistent Penalty dice the character is carrying.

#### 3. Drama pool = advantages or passions
1. If called upon, add additional Risk nRd as determined by either a dramatic advantage
2. And, if a dramatic passion is called into play add Drama 'nDd' dice

## Reading the Results
Roll the Base nBd, Penalty nPd, and any Drama nDd or Risk nRd dice... count the number of positive success and deduct the number of negative penalty successes to get a net successes result. 

In an unopposed teat, if the net successes is TWO or higher the test has been successful.
If the test is opposed, each participant needs to achieve net TWO successes, and then the higher of the two opposing rolls is successful. If result is tied, the winner is the participant who has momentum.


## Dice
The types of die are as follows;

## **Base Dice** (nBd)

Used for most skill checks or rolls, where D6 are rolled with each ‘5' & ‘6’ counting as a success.  

_`(1-3 fail, 4 (with benefit), 5-6 success)`_

## Dramatic **Risk Dice** (nRd)

Used when taking a Risk or an Advantage, usually in addition to base dice. D6 rolled with each 4, 5 & 6 counting as a successful, 6's explode but each 1 will count as -1 success and add 1 total penalty die. 

_`(1 risky fail, 2-3 fail, 4-5 success, 6 success & explode)`_

## **Dramatic Passion Dice** (nDd)

Used when invoking a deeply held dramatic passion, if two ‘1’s are rolled the passion backfires and triggers a dramatic negative reaction + number of ‘1’s x 3 in penalty dice!

_`(1 risky fail, 2-3 fail, 4-5 success, 6 success & explode)`_

## **Penalty Dice** (nPd)

Used to reflect the cumulative effects of stress, wounds or fatigue. They are rolled in addition to the positive dice with the risk of reducing the number of successes. D6 dice with 1 & 2's counting against successes

_`(1-2 negative success, 3-6 no effect)`_

Rolling a dice pool provides resolution as well as additional information which can add definition or colour to the result. The level of success or failure provides a guide to under or over performance. Major success results provide exaggerated results and consequences. The dice result that has the largest number of results (called width) can provide specific details on top of the underlying success.

It is important to pay attention the change of achieving 2+ successes
From "nBd" 'number' Base dice
2Bd = 11%
3Bd = 26%
4Bd = 41%
5Bd = 54%
6Bd = 65%
7Bd = 74%
8Bd = 80%
9Bd = 86%
10Bd = 90%

> It is close enough to think that 3 = 30%, 4 = 40% and 5 = 50% etc

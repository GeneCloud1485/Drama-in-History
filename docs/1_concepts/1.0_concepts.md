This is a **game about people**. Be inspired by drama, tragedy and romance.

It is a **role-playing game**.  The player actors have personality traits, detailed backgrounds with meaningful bonds to help bring them to life and connect them with the world.

It is also a **shared story**. It plays out in the minds of the players, where they look for dramatic scenes to add to their shared world.

**Inspired by history**. History is rich, and full of drama. Be inspired by historical fiction or TV. It shouldn't seek to be a historical simulation. It is your history, through the lens of your actors.

**Life isn't simple**. Expect games about people to be complex, emotional and providing dramatic struggles. Rarely should decisions be black or white.

# Assumptions
This won't be your first role-playing game. You are familiar with the common principles of role-playing games. And won't be phased by building a dice pool rather than a single die roll. And you will find creative inspiration by 'reading the pool' in the dice results. 

You are interested in real world history, but are unlikely to be a world expert in a given period. That shouldn't be a barrier to playing, although it can be a catalyst for you to immerse yourself into a setting more deeply.

You are willing to improvise, filling in the gas where needed, saying 'yes... and', being generous to the group's creativity and looking for interesting drama, challenge and struggle in scenes.

The core game system is flexible, and can be adapted to work with many different eras, settings and technology levels. While technology and culture changes over time, underneath it all we are human and share many of the same traits across the generations.

The core rules will be a living SRD available for free. Hopefully we can grow and refine the game together.

There are opportunities for specific rules and details related to an era which are not covered in the core rules, some will be added with specific settings and sandboxes expansions.


# Underlying Concepts

## Seasons, Stories & Scenes
Passage of time is an important aspect of the game, it helps to bring context, connection and believability to the characters and their world. Establishing families, building relationships with people over a period of years and exploring the drama in passing history. To help give a framework to the game’s year, it is split into 2 game **Seasons**; Spring & Summer (Easter to Michaelmas), Autumn & Winter (Michaelmas to Easter). 

The Spring & Summer season is the time for Stories, which is where the camera lingers on the drama as it plays out. The seasons of Autumn & Winter are condensed into opportunities for family, chronicle or campaign scenes. 

**Stories** contain the situations, ‘scenarios’ or ‘adventures’ that player are involved in. They are tend to be made up of a number of **Scenes.**

A **Scene** is way to think about a chunk of playable time, sometimes these are part of a longer Story and other times, especially in the Autumn & Winter seasons they can be condensed scenes to bring focus on a single situation or decision.

In more tactical situations or where time pressure matters. Minutes and Moments are used. 
A Moments is a period of 10 seconds and is the smallest chunk of time measured. A combat round is 10 seconds.

Most scenes are not time critical and can be run without concern of timekeeping. A few scenes will need more granular management, combat being a good example. In this context, scenes are broken into minutes and further broken into moments. Ten moments are considered to be a minute, and this provides a basic framework for reference more than a tactical second by second tracker.

# Roles
## The Director
Known as GM, DM, Ref, Keeper, etc in other games
## Player as Actors
Players, PC, characters.

The actors are the stars of the show, but they are also part of the wider cast.

## Non-Player Actors
The wider Cast & Cameo actors

Both player actors and non-player actors have an Actor Level which reflects their role in the stories. Both can change as time and the emphasis of the story changes. A non-player actor who is a supporting member of one story could be an actor in a later story, if their story arc has developed.

# Backgrounds
Previous history and backgrounds are valuable experience for an actor. They influence an actor's personality and provide specific knowledge, skills, and connections.

Backgrounds are tracked in bands of five or ten years to record an approximate history of the mains activities during that period of an actor's life.

A background can be a stand-in for more specific skills that are likely to have been learnt during a period of time spent in a background.

> E.g. an Actor who was an apprentice in the Merchant's Guild can be assumed to be able to count, to be aware of the Merchant's trade, to know how guild's work, have common courtesy and social skills. These skills are not 'advanced', but they are available to the actor if they have are not trained or accomplished in a specific skill.

### Military Training
Backgrounds which are reasonably considered providing military or combat training provide the actor an additional benefit. The number of military training backgrounds provide a small pool of bonus dice in combat.

# Underlying Mechanics: Building a Dice Pool
Rolling a pool of dice is used to test and resolve situations, conflicts or challenges. The pool is generated by bringing in a number of dice to reflect the underlying skill, additional advantages or risks being taken, or penalties for persistent status or situational modifiers. Different dice are used depending on the skill, advantage or penalty being applied to the pool. 

## General Guide to Building a Pool (BRD pools)
#### 1. BASE pool = Attribute + Skill
1. Take the appropriate underlying attribute
2. Add a single directly appropriate skill, capped by the appropriate attribute
3. If no appropriate skill is available then take an appropriate background experience
	1. [TODO] simplify the calculation of backgrounds into dice

#### 2. RESISTANCE pool = modifiers + penalties + resistance
1. How hard is the test? add resistance penalty dice nRd
2. Any modifiers due to circumstance either nBd or nRd or both
   (note: don't cancel or net off applied dice, add them both into the pool)
3. Any important personality modifiers - scars, strengths or bonds
4. Plus any persistent Penalty dice the character is carrying.

#### 3. DRAMA pool = advantages or passions
1. If called upon, add additional Risk nDd as determined by either a dramatic advantage, risk or dramatic passion is called into play 

## Reading the Results
Roll the Base nBd, Penalty nPd, and any Drama nDd or Risk nRd dice... count the number of positive success and deduct the number of negative penalty successes to get a net successes result. 

In an unopposed test, if the net successes is TWO or higher the test has been successful.
If the test is opposed, each participant needs to achieve net TWO successes, and then the higher of the two opposing rolls is successful. If result is tied, the winner is the participant who has momentum.


# Types of Dice
It is recommended to use colored dice pools to represent each of the types of dices. Ideally a minimum of three different colored sets of dice are available. The types of dice are as follows;

## **Base Dice** (nBd = Number of Base dice)

Used for most skill checks or rolls, where D6 are rolled with each ‘5' & ‘6’ counting as a success.  

_`(1-3 = fail, 4 with a Drama Point = success, 5-6 = success)`_

## **Resistance** Penalty Dice (nRd = Number of Resistance dice)

Used to reflect the cumulative effects of stress, wounds or fatigue. They are rolled in addition to the positive dice with the risk of reducing the number of successes. D6 dice with 1 & 2's counting against successes

_`(1-2 = negative success, 3-6 = no effect)

## **Dramatic** Risk Dice (nDd = Number of Resistance dice)

Used when taking a Risk, a dramatic Advantage or calling upon a passion, usually in addition to base dice. D6 rolled with each 4, 5 & 6 counting as a successful, 6's explode but each 1 will count as -1 success and add 1 total penalty die. 

_`(1 = risky fail, 2-3 = fail, 4-5 = success, 6 = success & explode)`_

Used when invoking a deeply held dramatic passion, if two ‘1’s are rolled in the drama pool the passion backfires triggering a dramatic negative reaction + number of ‘1’s x 2 in penalty dice!

## **Armor Dice** (nAd = Number of Armor dice)

Used to determine the defensive value of armor, cover or defensive fighting, where D6 are rolled with each ‘5' & ‘6’ counting as a success.  

_`(1-4 = fail, 5-6 = success)`_

## **Tension** Dice (Director only dice)
Tension dice are a pool of Drama dice available to the Director to amp up the tension or drama at key moments. They are wild cards, which can be use to help non-player actors or player actors depending on the situation.

## Additional Resolution Information

Rolling a dice pool provides resolution as well as additional information which can add definition or colour to the result. The level of success or failure provides a guide to under or over performance. Major success results provide exaggerated results and consequences. The dice result that has the largest number of results (called width) can provide specific details on top of the underlying success.



![[Dice Pool Statistics.png]]

It is important to pay attention the change of achieving 2+ successes
From "nBd" 'number' Base dice
- 2Bd = 11%
- 3Bd = 26%
- 4Bd = 41%
- 5Bd = 54%
- 6Bd = 65%
- 7Bd = 74%
- 8Bd = 80%
- 9Bd = 86%
- 10Bd = 90%

> It is close enough to think that 3 = 30%, 4 = 40% and 5 = 50% etc

## Reading the Pool
Rolling three sets of dice (BRD), you can potentially get more interesting information from the results than from a single pass/fail die roll.

Looking at the level of success, being inspired by the patterns in the results especially when the Drama dice explode or backfire can bring color to your results.

# Core Ideas
- Games about people
	- People are complex, nuanced, with goals, personality traits and passions.
	- They have lives, bonds and lives that provide background and context
- Encourage and value role play
	- Where the role play is reflected into mechanics
- A collaborative world
	- Yes, and...
	- Populating the world together with people and stories
	- Fits Sandbox better than linear Quests
- Seek opportunities for Challenge & Struggle as life isn't simple
	- Challenges to be overcome
	- Struggles to be grappled with

# Underlying Concepts

## Seasons, Stories & Scenes
Passage of time is an important aspect of the game, it helps to bring context, connection and believability to the characters and their world. Establishing families, building relationships with people over a period of years and exploring the drama in passing history. To help give a framework to the game’s year, it is split into 2 game **Seasons**; Spring & Summer (Easter to Michaelmas), Autumn & Winter (Michaelmas to Easter). 

The Spring & Summer season is the time for Stories, which is where the camera lingers on the drama as it plays out. The seasons of Autumn & Winter are condensed into opportunities for family, chronicle or campaign scenes. 

**Stories** contain the situations, ‘scenarios’ or ‘adventures’ that player are involved in. They are tend to be made up of a number of **Scenes.**

A **Scene** is way to think about a chunk of playable time, sometimes these are part of a longer Story and other times, especially in the Autumn & Winter seasons they can be condensed scenes to bring focus on a single situation or decision.

Minutes & Moments… [TODO]

Most scenes are not time critical and can be run without concern of timekeeping. A few scenes will need more granular management, combat being a good example. In this context, scenes are broken into minutes and further broken into moments. Ten moments are considered to be a minute, and this provides a basic framework for reference more than a tactical second by second tracker.

# Roles
## The Director
Known as GM, DM, Ref, Keeper, etc in other games
## Player as Actors
Players, PC, characters.

The actors are the stars of the show, but they are also part of the wider cast.

## Non-Player Actors
NPC, Cast

The wider cast 

Both player actors and non-player actors have an Actor Level which reflects their role in the stories. Both can change as time and the emphasis of the story changes. A non-player actor who is a supporting member of one story could be an actor in a later story, if their story arc has developed.


# Background Life
Previous history and backgrounds are valuable experience for an actor. They influence an actor's personality and provide background specific knowledge, skills, and connections.

Backgrounds are tracked in bands of five or ten years to record an approximate history of the mains activities during that period of an actor's life.

A background can be a stand-in for more specific skills that are likely to have been learnt during a period of time spent in a background.

> E.g. an Actor who was an apprentice in the Merchant's Guild can be assumed to be able to count, to be aware of the Merchant's trade, to know how guild's work, have common courtesy and social skills. These skills are not 'advanced', but they are available to the actor if they have are not trained or accomplished in a specific skill.

# Underlying Mechanics: Building a Dice Pool
Rolling a pool of dice is used to test and resolve situations, conflicts or challenges. The pool is generated by bringing in a number of dice to reflect the underlying skill, additional advantages or risks being taken, or penalties for persistent status or situational modifiers. Different dice are used depending on the skill, advantage or penalty being applied to the pool. 

## General Guide to Building a Pool (BRD pools)
#### 1. BASE pool = Attribute + Skill
1. Take the appropriate underlying attribute
2. Add a single directly appropriate skill
3. If no appropriate skill is available then take an appropriate background experience
	1. [TODO] simplify the calculation of backgrounds into dice

#### 2. RESISTANCE pool = modifiers + penalties + resistance
1. How hard is the test? add resistance penalty dice nRd
2. Any modifiers due to circumstance either nBd or nRd or both
   (note: don't cancel or net off applied dice, add them both into the pool)
3. Any important personality modifiers - scars, strengths or bonds
4. Plus any persistent Penalty dice the character is carrying.

#### 3. DRAMA pool = advantages or passions
1. If called upon, add additional Risk nDd as determined by either a dramatic advantage, risk or dramatic passion is called into play 

## Reading the Results
Roll the Base nBd, Penalty nPd, and any Drama nDd or Risk nRd dice... count the number of positive success and deduct the number of negative penalty successes to get a net successes result. 

In an unopposed test, if the net successes is TWO or higher the test has been successful.
If the test is opposed, each participant needs to achieve net TWO successes, and then the higher of the two opposing rolls is successful. If result is tied, the winner is the participant who has momentum.


# Types of Dice
The types of die are as follows;

## **Base Dice** (nBd = Number X Base dice)

Used for most skill checks or rolls, where D6 are rolled with each ‘5' & ‘6’ counting as a success.  

_`(1-3 = fail, 4 with a Drama Point = success, 5-6 = success)`_

## **Resistance** Penalty Dice (nRd = Number of Resistance dice)

Used to reflect the cumulative effects of stress, wounds or fatigue. They are rolled in addition to the positive dice with the risk of reducing the number of successes. D6 dice with 1 & 2's counting against successes

_`(1-2 = negative success, 3-6 = no effect)

## **Dramatic** Risk Dice (nDd = Number of Resistance dice)

Used when taking a Risk, a dramatic Advantage or calling upon a passion, usually in addition to base dice. D6 rolled with each 4, 5 & 6 counting as a successful, 6's explode but each 1 will count as -1 success and add 1 total penalty die. 

_`(1 = risky fail, 2-3 = fail, 4-5 = success, 6 = success & explode)`_

Used when invoking a deeply held dramatic passion, if two ‘1’s are rolled in the drama pool the passion backfires triggering a dramatic negative reaction + number of ‘1’s x 2 in penalty dice!

## **Tension** Dice (Director only dice)
Tension dice are a pool of Drama dice available to the Director to amp up the tension or drama at key moments. They are wild cards, which can be use to help non-player actors or player actors depending on the situation.

## Additional Resolution Information

Rolling a dice pool provides resolution as well as additional information which can add definition or colour to the result. The level of success or failure provides a guide to under or over performance. Major success results provide exaggerated results and consequences. The dice result that has the largest number of results (called width) can provide specific details on top of the underlying success.

It is important to pay attention the change of achieving 2+ successes
From "nBd" 'number' Base dice
2Bd = 11%
3Bd = 26%
4Bd = 41%
5Bd = 54%
6Bd = 65%
7Bd = 74%
8Bd = 80%
9Bd = 86%
10Bd = 90%

> It is close enough to think that 3 = 30%, 4 = 40% and 5 = 50% etc

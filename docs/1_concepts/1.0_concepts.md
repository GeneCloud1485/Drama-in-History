# Underlying Concepts

## Seasons, Stories & Scenes
Passage of time is an important aspect of the game, it helps to bring context, connection and believability to the characters and their world. Establishing families, building relationships with people over a period of years and exploring the drama in passing history. To help give a framework to the game’s year, it is split into 2 game **Seasons**; Spring & Summer (Easter to Michaelmas), Autumn & Winter (Michaelmas to Easter). 

The Spring & Summer season is the time for Stories, which is where the camera lingers on the drama as it plays out. The seasons of Autumn & Winter are condensed into opportunities for family, chronicle or campaign scenes. 

**Stories** contain the situations, ‘scenarios’ or ‘adventures’ that player are involved in. They are tend to be made up of a number of **Scenes.**

A **Scene** is way to think about a chunk of playable time, sometimes these are part of a longer Story and other times, especially in the Autumn & Winter seasons they can be condensed scenes to bring focus on a single situation or decision.

In more tactical situations or where time pressure matters. Minutes and Moments are used. 
A Moments is a period of 10 seconds and is the smallest chunk of time measured. A combat round is 10 seconds.

Most scenes are not time critical and can be run without concern of timekeeping. A few scenes will need more granular management, combat being a good example. In this context, scenes are broken into minutes and further broken into moments. Ten moments are considered to be a minute, and this provides a basic framework for reference more than a tactical second by second tracker.

# Roles
## The Director
Known as GM, DM, Ref, Keeper, etc in other games
## Player as Actors
Players, PC, characters.

The actors are the stars of the show, but they are also part of the wider cast.

## Non-Player Actors
The wider Cast & Cameo actors

Both player actors and non-player actors have an Actor Level which reflects their role in the stories. Both can change as time and the emphasis of the story changes. A non-player actor who is a supporting member of one story could be an actor in a later story, if their story arc has developed.

# Backgrounds
Previous history and backgrounds are valuable experience for an actor. They influence an actor's personality and provide specific knowledge, skills, and connections.

Backgrounds are tracked in bands of five or ten years to record an approximate history of the mains activities during that period of an actor's life.

A background can be a stand-in for more specific skills that are likely to have been learnt during a period of time spent in a background.

> E.g. an Actor who was an apprentice in the Merchant's Guild can be assumed to be able to count, to be aware of the Merchant's trade, to know how guild's work, have common courtesy and social skills. These skills are not 'advanced', but they are available to the actor if they have are not trained or accomplished in a specific skill.

### Military Training
Backgrounds which are reasonably considered providing military or combat training provide the actor an additional benefit. The number of military training backgrounds provide a small pool of bonus dice in combat.


# Types of Dice
It is recommended to use colored dice pools to represent each of the types of dices. Ideally a minimum of three different colored sets of dice are available. The types of dice are as follows;

## **Base Dice** (nBd = number of BASE dice)

Used for most skill checks or rolls, where D6 are rolled with each ‘5' & ‘6’ counting as a success.  

_`(1-3 = fail, 4 with a Drama Point = success, 5-6 = success)`_

## **Resistance** Penalty Dice (nRd = number of RESISTANCE dice)

Used to reflect the cumulative effects of stress, wounds or fatigue. They are rolled in addition to the positive dice with the risk of reducing the number of successes. D6 dice with 1 & 2's counting against successes

_`(1-2 = negative success, 3-6 = no effect)

## **Dramatic** Risk Dice (nDd = number of DRAMA dice)

Used when taking a Risk, a dramatic Advantage or calling upon a passion, usually in addition to base dice. D6 rolled with each 4, 5 & 6 counting as a successful, 6's explode but each 1 will count as -1 success and add 1 total penalty die. 

_`(1 = risky fail, 2-3 = fail, 4-5 = success, 6 = success & explode)`_

Used when invoking a deeply held dramatic passion, if two ‘1’s are rolled in the drama pool the passion backfires triggering a dramatic negative reaction + number of ‘1’s x 2 in penalty dice!

## **Armor Dice** (nAd = number of ARMOR dice)

Used to determine the defensive value of armor, cover or defensive fighting, where D6 are rolled with each ‘5' & ‘6’ counting as a success.  

_`(1-4 = fail, 5-6 = success)`_

## **Tension** Dice (Director only dice)
Tension dice are a pool of Drama dice available to the Director to amp up the tension or drama at key moments. They are wild cards, which can be use to help non-player actors or player actors depending on the situation.


# Underlying Mechanics: Building a Dice Pool
Rolling a pool of dice is used to test and resolve situations, conflicts or challenges. The same format is used for all resolution; establish the **base pool** of positive dice, against the negative **resistance pool** reflecting the difficulty or situational modifiers and in some cases, add a **drama pool** of special, drama advantage dice.

The only dice used are 6 six sided dice, but what counts as a success or failure varies with the different pools. 

> E.g. Base pool dice simple track successes on '5' or '6' results. Throughout the dice notation and examples are written as 5 Bd meaning 5 base dice. And often with {6,5,4,1,1} showing an example result in { } brackets, in this case the result from the base pool would be 2 successes

## General Guide to Building a Pool (BRD pools)
#### 1. BASE pool = Attribute + Skill
Generate the base **positive** pool of dice as the core of the resolution. A base pool will always be built for a resolution test.

1. Take the appropriate underlying attribute
2. Add a single directly appropriate skill, capped by the appropriate attribute
3. If no appropriate skill is available then take an appropriate background experience
	1. [TODO] simplify the calculation of backgrounds into dice

#### 2. RESISTANCE pool = modifiers + penalties + resistance
The **negative** pool of dice that resist the base dice pool. A resistance pool usually be built, unless the test is simple, un-resisted or being performed in perfect circumstances.

1. How hard is the test? add resistance penalty dice nRd
2. Any modifiers due to circumstance either nBd or nRd or both
   (note: don't cancel or net off applied dice, add them both into the pool)
3. Any important personality modifiers - scars, strengths or bonds
4. Plus any persistent Penalty dice the character is carrying.

#### 3. DRAMA pool = advantages or passions
A pool which can generate **positive or negative** results, and swing the outcome of the contest or resolution. A drama pool is general only built when the actor decides to spend a resource or take advantage of a dramatic opportunity.

1. If called upon, add additional Risk nDd as determined by either a dramatic advantage, risk or dramatic passion is called into play 

## Reading the Results
Roll the Base nBd, Penalty nPd, and any Drama nDd dice... count the number of positive success and deduct the number of negative penalty successes to get a net successes result. 

### Two Net Successes
In an unopposed test, if the net successes is TWO or higher the test has been successful.
If the test is opposed, each participant needs to achieve net TWO successes, and then the higher of the two opposing rolls is successful. If result is tied, the winner is the participant who has momentum.

The target is always two net successes. Net success is the positive 'successes' minus the resistance 'fails'.

> E.g. 6Bd {6,5,5,3,3,1} three successes and 3Rd {4,3,2} one fail equals two net successes

### Level of Success
In an opposed roll, the level of success is the difference between the two sets of net successes. 

> E.g. Actor #1 has 3 net successes and Actor #2 has 1 net success, leading Actor #1 to have a level of success of 2

### Marginal Success
When the outcome is one net success, a marginal success is achieved. This is a "Yes, But..." outcome, where an additional price would have to be paid to convert to a success.

## Reading the Pool
From the results of rolling three sets of dice (BRD), you are able to get more interesting information from the results than from a single pass/fail die roll. This information can help narrating the scene, adjusting the details of the outcome or just providing color. It can also be ignored without any mechanical impact if you prefer.

> E.g. 3 base successes and 3 resistance fails means that the test has failed. The actor's attempt would have been successful it wasn't for the resistance, which could indicate the weather got the better of them, it could be that the difficulty of the challenge was too much for them or that the target was wise to their influence.

> E.g. 1 base success, 2 resistance fails and 3 drama successes means that the test is passed with a net 2 successes. The actor would have failed if it wasn't for the dramatic action or advantage that they applied to this situation.

> E.g. 3 base successes, 1 resistance fail and 1 drama fail, indicates that the attempted dramatic advantage has backfired turning what would otherwise have been a success into a net one marginal success. This can be the focus of the narrative outcome, and inspire the price that actor might need to pay to upgrade their marginal to a full success.

Looking at the level of success, being inspired by the patterns in the results especially when the Drama dice explode or backfire can bring color to your results.

[TODO Dice patterns]
- Trips no inc 6
- 4s (close to successes) unlock success for win/loss outcome

## Additional Resolution Information

Rolling a dice pool provides resolution as well as additional information which can add definition or colour to the result. The level of success or failure provides a guide to under or over performance. Major success results provide exaggerated results and consequences. The dice result that has the largest number of results (called width) can provide specific details on top of the underlying success.

It is important to pay attention the change of achieving 2+ successes
From "nBd" 'number' Base dice
- 2Bd = 11%
- 3Bd = 26%
- 4Bd = 41%
- 5Bd = 54%
- 6Bd = 65%
- 7Bd = 74%
- 8Bd = 80%
- 9Bd = 86%
- 10Bd = 90%

> It is close enough to think that 3 = 30%, 4 = 40% and 5 = 50% etc

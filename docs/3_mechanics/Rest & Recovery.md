# How to Recover?
## Penalty Dice

Penalties are recovered by sleep or serious rest. Each point requires 3 hours sleep to recover from. 
- If an age cap penalty exists, then the last point will take a full day of rest to recover from.


## Composure
Composure is recovered by restful calm without the stressful trigger circumstances. Relaxation can take many forms, and can be aided by external situation and/or influences (music, drink, drugs, sex, meditation etc)
-> 1 hour = current raised to max - current penalty - age penalty cap + external benefits
-> Each point after the 1st hour takes 2 hours to recover from  

## Grit
Grit is recovered by physically resting for an hour. Physical benefits can boost the recovery countering age or penalties (e.g. drink, drugs, energy bars, massage etc)
-> 1 hour = current raised to max - current penalty - age penalty cap + external benefits
-> Each point after the 1st hours takes 2 hours to recover from

* Do Penalty and Composure and Grit recover in parallel? -> yes
* Can't recover penalties caused by loss of Grit/Composure/infection until they have been recovered back to half or more.

## Flesh
Critical Flesh adds +1 month to the recovery time

## Fortitude
Fortitude is recovered through rest and calm contemplation.Â 

Once per story a character can make a narratively appropriate test to recover fortitude. Based on the actor level of the character, that many points per Story can be recovered through a narratively appropriate skill hard test, the recovery returns at 1 point per hour.

> _E.g. A monk encountering a ghost in the crypt of a church suffers the loss of 1 Fortitude. The monk, an 'Actor' can recover up to 2 points per Story. He decides to spend an hour in prayer at the Altar to calm himself. A successful Prayer test allows him to recover the lost point._

Other than this Fortitude takes 1 month per point to recover. This can happen during the summer but is more often recovered over the winter period.

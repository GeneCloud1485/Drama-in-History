# Drunkenness

After a period of indulgence and drinking to excess a state of drunkenness modifies personality traits, attribute pools and skill checks. The effects are broken into two tiers; Drunk and Very/Blind Drunk. Drunk is the 'normal' state of drunkenness after a period of indulgent drinking. Blind Drunk is only achieved after 'extreme' drinking and consumption.

**While drunk the following are all applied until the drunkenness passes;**

When drunk a character's courage and belief in themselves is exaggerated, at a cost of thinking straight and agility.

- **Plus 1Dd dice for**;
	-  All social based skills
	-  All pool checks - composure, fortitude, grit and flesh
	-  An additional Temporary Trait e.g. Courage, Rash, Indulgent 
- **Plus 2Rd for everything else**;
	- Knowledge based on Mental
	- Any context where being drunk is frowned upon

**Blind Drunk/Very Drunk**

- Drunk effects
- **Plus 2Dd for;**
	- Fortitude and Courage checks	- 
- **Plus 4Rd for everything else**â€¦ including Social skills, Composure & Grit checks 


## Mechanics: Drugged Drunkenness Variant

[TODO] = Muses & creativity over social


# Disease [TODO]

1. Exposure & Contamination
	1. Test luck
	2. Plus protection nBd modifiers
	3. Plus exposure nRd modifiers
	4. Plus boons/flaws or benefits
2. Severity & Symptoms
	1. Specific to the disease
	2. Severity modified by success/failure of exposure
		1. Persistent penalties
3. Recovery
	1. Specific to the disease
	2. ... could just be recovery of the significant number of penalties?
4. Consequences
	1. Attribute damage in the extreme

# People  & Connections [TODO]

Building a record of meaningful people

## Three Meaningful Scenes

1. Contact
2. Connection
3. Commitment

# Complex Challenge Tests
Some problems are extremely complex, protracted and involved that a single test is not sufficient to resolve. In a case of a protracted challenge test the results of multiple rounds combine to measure progress overcoming a challenge.

Each complex test is unique and can allow different combinations of the cost of success and failure. The dimensions of the Complex Test may be transparent and clear to the actor, or it may be hidden, and only understood when earlier dimensions are resolved.

Resolving the Complex Test;
1. Tackle **each of the dimensions in turn**, each dimension can have a different resistance and cost
	1. Some dimensions are one attempt only
	2. Some have a cost for failure
	3. And others allow a second attempt with an alternate cost.
2. Success on a dimension **unlocks the next dimension**, and often will require a price to be paid. That cost could vary depending if it is the 1st or 2nd attempt.
4. On a second attempt, the resistance is generally 2Rd less
5. **Failure on the second attempt**, means that the dimension stays locked and the overall test has been failed. 

Failed Complex Tests can be potentially be re-attempted once something substantial about the actor(s) or the situation has changed - growth in skills, new teacher, significant time has passed.

The Director can set most anything as a price to be paid for success and/or failure. Some examples;
- Coin e.g. bribes or payments
- Specific resources or items e.g. Alchemical components
- Time e.g. time investment required
- Fortitude e.g. disturbing knowledge that is unsettling 
- Flesh e.g. a physical price to pay either an indirect consequence like a wound, or as a required contribution like a blood sacrifice...
- Creation or breaking of a bond e.g. membership of a fraternity, or shaking of a previously held faith
- Addition of a scar or strength e.g. confidence in their new knowledge, an actor gains a strength related to that knowlegde
- Boon or Flaw e.g. temporary good luck will follow the actor, gaining +1Bd on luck checks (6Bd vs 6Rd)

Successful resolution will achieve the outcome, in some circumstances due to failed tests a partial outcomes can be achieved. Like failed tests, a partial outcome can't be improved upon unless something significant has changed.

> Example - Attempting to read a complex book of arcane knowledge, the *Treatise on the Celestial Mind* or "Tractatus de Mente Coelesti".

> The book is an arcane tome with 3 dimensions of complexity which need to be unlocked to receive the wisdom and knowledge it contains.
> 
> The first dimension is Geometry, it is difficult to understand (10Rd) but has no price to pay for an initial success. Failure on the 1st attempt means paying the cost of failure (loss of 1 Fort point). A second attempt is allowed, and the subsequent attempt is a little easier (8Rd), but success on the second attempt will limit the total value of the whole test to a partial outcome. Failure on the 2nd attempt will incur another cost, and will block further progress until something substantial changes about the reader or their resources.

> The second dimension is Astronomy, the price for the 1st attempt is the passage of time (1 month), there is no additional cost of failure and a second attempt will take a further passage of time (2 months).

> The third dimension is Religion, this test is more of a revelation and no subsequent attempts are allowed. Success incurs a cost (loss of 1F) before unlocking the reward/outcome of the complex test. Failure will end the Test, and incurs a substantial cost (-3 Fortitude + test for a scar)

| Dimension | Resistance | Price on 1st attempt | Price on 2nd attempt | Cost of failure |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Geometry | 10Rd | n/a | Partial Outcome | -1 Fort |
| Astronomy | 8Rd | 1 month | 2 months | n/a | 
| Religion | 8Rd | -1 Fort |none allowed | -3 Fort^1 | 

> ^1 Test Fort pool or receive a scar 

> The result of the Complex Test is either a full or partial Outcome. 
> 
> In this case the full outcome provides Training level skill in 'Celestial Mind' and an awareness or faith in the interconnectedness of the celestial and the human condition. This creates a Bond, which is immediately taken and which challenges any bond of faith or religion which exists.  The existing bond of faith or religion must be tested or potentially broken...

> A partial outcome will create the bond and challenge existing bonds of faith without the training.

# Critical and Unintended Consequences
## Three '6s' is a Critical
A CRITICAL success is achieved when 3 or more "6"s are rolled in the Base or Drama dice pools. Count the total number of "6"s in the positive Base and Drama dice pool, and deduct the number of "1"s in the negative Resistance dice pool, the result is added to the number of successes total. A critical result in combat has an additional effect [TODO link]

> E.g. 7 Base dice and 4 Resistance dice
> 
>  7Bd: {6,6,6,5,3,3,1}  plus 4Pd: {4,4,2,1} creates an initial 2 net successes (4 positive and 2 negative). The 3 "6"s reveal a critical, which adds 2 (3-1) additional successes to the original result, bringing the final result to 4. 

Any critical results provide the Director adds a Tension Die to their Tension Pool. [TODO]

## Three '1s' cause Unintended Outcomes
A Unintended Outcomes happens when 3 or more '1s' are rolled in the Resistance pool result. Although it is likely that any test which has 3+ resistance successes will be unlikely to succeed, it isn't necessarily the case. Regardless of the success, the interesting point of an Unintended Outcome is to add in something more dramatic, challenging or trigger an inner struggle for the Actor.

> E.g 5 Base dice and 8 Resistance dice 5Bd {6,3,3,2,1} and 8Rd {6,5,5,3,2,1,1,1} is a net -3 successes, triggering an unintended outcome.
> 
> In this example the archer firing at the distant archery butt seriously misjudged the wind and sent their arrow flying wide. The arrow slammed into the wooden structure on which the notables of the fair were sitting, causing everyone to dive for cover!

It is theoretically possible to get both a Critical and Unintended Outcomes in the same result of the dice pool - time to get creative with the narrative outcomes!

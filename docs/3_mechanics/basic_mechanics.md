Choosing appropriate skills and attributes

## Success or Failure?
### Two Successes Needed
Tests take a number of forms and draw upon a variety of attributes, skills and factors, but ultimately the goal is the same - to achieve a net of TWO successes. Achieving two success is always enough to gain a base success, the difficulty of a test is handled via the additional of resistance dice or by an opposed roll. Gaining more than two successes is an indication of greater level of success, which in some circumstances can improve or expand on the success.

> E.g. 6 Base dice 
> 6Bd: 5, 5, 4, 3, 1, 1 = 2 net successes
> 
> or 5 Base dice and 2 Resistance dice 
> 5Bd: 6, 5, 3, 2, 2  & 2Rd: 2, 2 = 0 net successes and a failure

### One equals Yes, But...
What about ONE success? It is close and triggers the option of a YES, BUT result if the character can pay a meaningful price to achieve a success. The penalty could be narrative, could be a currency costs (attribute pool) or the addition of a persistent penalty - this is determined in negotiation with the Director.

> E.g. 4 Base dice
> 4Bd: 5, 2, 2, 1 = 1 net success requiring an additional price to be paid to succeed.

### Three '6s' is a Critical
A CRITICAL success is achieved when 3 or more "6"s are rolled in the Base or Drama dice pools. Count the total number of "6"s in the positive Base and Drama dice pool, and deduct the number of "1"s in the negative Resistance dice pool, the result is added to the number of successes total. A critical result in combat has an additional effect [TODO link]

> E.g. 7 Base dice and 4 Resistance dice
>  7Bd: {6, 6, 6, 5, 3, 3, 1}  plus 4Pd: {4, 4, 2, 1} creates an initial 2 net successes (4 positive and 2 negative). The 3 "6"s reveal a critical, which adds 2 (3-1) additional successes to the original result, bringing the final result to 4. 

Any critical results provide the Director adds a Tension Die to their Tension Pool. [TODO]

### Three '1s' is a Critical Failure
A CRITICAL FAILURE happens when 3 or more '1s' are rolled in the Resistance pool result. The net number of resistance '1s' after deducting the Base & Drama pool '6s' are added to resistance pool successes

> E.g 5 Base dice and 8 Resistance dice
> 5Bd {6, 3, 3, 2, 1} and 8Rd {6, 5, 5, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1} creates an initial net -3 successes. The 3 '1s' in the resistance pool add an additional net -2 net successes, leading to a final result of -5 successes and a complete, unmitigated failure!

It is likely that any test which has 3+ resistance successes will be unlikely to succeed, the critical failure makes that a certainty. The interesting value is to turn the failure into something more dramatic, challenging or trigger an inner struggle.

It is theoretically possible to get both a Critical and Critical Failure in the dice pool. The net successes will likely cancel each other out, use the opportunity to make the net result more exaggerated with the two critical results contributing to the dramatic outcome.

#  **Base Attribute Test**
A simple attribute test is used as a basic and catch-all test, either opposed or unopposed. The pool is built from the attribute + situational modifiers and penalty dice.

An attribute check can sometimes be used where there isn’t an applicable skills, but never in place of a skill. This test is based on one of the Phy Agl Men Soc attributes.

 >_E.g. A cart wheel stuck in a rutted track, a straightforward challenge requiring 2 successes on a Physical attribute check. Young William puts his shoulder to the wheel and rolls his physical of 2._

> _He fails to move the cart and calls to his friend Peter of Lynn, who puts his shoulder to the other wheel and provides his 2 physical to help. The two roll (2 and 2) achieving 3 successes between them and they shove the cart free of the rut._

# **Skill Tests**
Skill tests can contain a number of combinations; single test, opposed, co-operative, multiple opponents and could consist of a single test or a series of tests.

For unopposed tests, calculate the dice pool and roll to determine the number of successes to compare with the target number.

For opposed tests, the parties calculate their dice pools and then compare the results to determine the levels of success.

For complex or co-operative tests, additional dice can be added to a pool from assisting parties, pools can be split against multiple opponents and the test can be a series of tests.

## **Levels of Difficulty**

Level of difficulty is reflected in the addition of penalty/resistance dice to the pool so that the target number is always 2 success to pass the test.

Very Easy through formidable

+2Bd / 0 / 2Rd / 4Rd / 6Rd / 8Rd

## **Unopposed** Skill Tests
A simple unopposed test pits the skill of a person against the level of difficulty or resistance of a challenge.

Build a dice pool from Base, Resistance, and Drama dice.
1. **Base pool** = Attribute + Skill, or background
2. **Resistance pool** = persistent penalties + difficulty of the challenge + situational modifiers
3. **Drama pool** = risks, dramatic advantages or passions applicable

The pools are rolled and the number of net successes is calculated. If two or more net successes are achieved then the test is successful.

## **Resisted** Skill Tests 
A resisted skill test is used for where another person is being affected or influenced by the test, and so have a resistance to the skill. It is very similar to an unopposed skill test, with the addition of extra resistance from the targets stats or skills.

Build a dice pool from Base, Resistance, and Drama dice.
1. **Base pool** = Attribute + Skill, or background
2. **Resistance pool** = persistent penalties + difficulty of the challenge + situational modifiers + **the stat or skill of the target** in resistance
3. **Drama pool** = risks, dramatic advantages or passions applicable

The pools are rolled and the number of net successes is calculated. If two or more net successes are achieved then the test is successful.


## **Opposed** Skill Tests

Opposed test have all of the same core elements as unopposed, rather than focusing on a target number of successes, the goal is to get more successes than the opposition. The degree of success is determined by the net difference between the two outcomes, and as with unopposed rolls, the scale of the difference  indicates how successful the outcome is.

One form of opposed test might be a hunter and prey. While they may use different skills, be effected by different situational modifiers they still build a dice pool and compare the results.

The two most complex forms of opposed test are Social Contests and Combat, and they have additional rules to be considered.

## Currency Tests
The currency pools are Flesh, Grit, Composure and Fortitude. Each can be tested 

## **Opposed Social Contests**

_Design Goals: To encourage role-playing in line with the characters and story for mechanical advantages in resolving a complex opposed contest. Imaginative, narrative and dramatic role-play on the part of the players should contribute 50% of the dice pool. In most cases, the NPCs should present brief narrative and character defense, but use their composure pool rather than the GM counter arguing for dice._

A social contest brings together narrative & role-play with skills & context into a complex opposed dice pool test. The scene should be setup by establishing the contest goal, then freeform role-play which brings the major advantages into play. After the role-play reaches an appropriate and dramatic point the pools are calculated and rolled to see the result. Each contest should be resolved in one test, although it is possible to keep the contest going if it is satisfactorily resolves, but the skill checks & advantages & narrative needs to be different in the second round.

## **Tests of Fortitude** 

A test of fortitude is made whenever the character is faced with a disturbing, shocking, horrific or scary situation. These can be the results of phobias, encounters with death, disease or horrors of the battle field, or engaging in mortal sins

**Loss of Fortitude**

Loss of Fortitude reflects a weakening of the mind and a grasp on reality. If a character's Fortitude is reduced to 0 they are taken temporarily mad and unable to act meaningfully. 

TODO Lasting scars - is there a need to have a partial madness from loss in one story?


**Uncontrolled Shock Effects**

Highest # of Results | Effect

6| Attempt to fight the source of the fear
5| Shout, rant and scream - incoherent, quoting biblical texts, speaking in tongues
4| Attempt to flee the scene, turn away and keep back to threat and be obsessed with leaving the scene
3| Emotional & passionate response - cry, wail, impassioned railing against the situation
2| Gag, vomit and freeze. Feel shortage of breath and hyper-tension.
1| Rock catatonic, immobile, unresponsive and vulnerable


## **Test of Composure**

A test of composure is made when the character needs to keep their cool, deal with social status pressure, contain their anger or passion, deal with feelings of uncertainty, strange atmospheres, fear

These are unopposed single tests and are different than a social contest, the outcome of a composure check confirms the persons confidence in dealing with a situation and can apply penalties if failed. 

[TODO] - how to simplify composure into skill checks like this?
A composure check can be made before a subsequent test, but should aim to ask & resolve a different question and not just be a 'double' dice test.

_E.g. Checking composure before making a Lie skill check is not necessary, the lie skill check would be enough._

**Social failure effects**

Result | Effect

6| No additional effects
5| Exaggerated discomfort = double 'degree of failure' in composure loss
4| Emotional reaction, visible to all. Reduce an existing or gain a negative bond or passion
3| Sadness which lasts the 'degree of failure' in days
2| Dizziness & Nausea, additional +1 Penalty
1| A stress induced Scar +1

As well as any mechanical outcome the results should provide guidance on how to behave and informs role-playing.

# Protracted Complex Challenge Tests
Some problems are extremely complex, protracted and involved that a single test is not sufficient to resolve. In a case of a protracted challenge test the results of multiple rounds combine to measure progress overcoming a challenge.

# **Penalty Dice**

Penalty dice generally represent persistent but temporary stress, pressure or disadvantage that a character is suffering from. They can be gained as a result of a number of actions or outcomes, and can be recovered by a combination of rest/time and the removal of the cause. They differ from a situational modifier, which would typically be applied for just one test or roll.

**Examples of persistent penalties;**

-   Fatigue - results of prolonged exposure, hunger/thirst etc or an exhausted pool of Grit
-   Fear or Morale - results of a failed Mortal Fear check
-   Uncertainty & Stress - resulting from failed awareness in stressful situation (exploring), before battle, in unknown territory with failed Country Life, failing a social roll under scrutiny
-   Discombobulated - lost of social contest
-   Drunk or drugged - excess consumption

The total pool adds penalty die equal to its current total to **all** skills, actions or tests, except trait checks. 

Occasionally it might be possible to convert a penalty to an advantage, but rolled as a risk

> _E.g. being somewhat drunk could be argued to be a bonus on some Social or Physical tests_

[TODO] penalty die as the price of failure

**Combined levels of penalty**

-   1-3 penalty = **distracted**
-   4-6 penalty = **shaken**
-   7-9 penalty = **stressed** with a constant reminder
-   10+ = leaves a character **broken** and unable to act effectively

Penalty dice are applied to all healing or recovery checks and will modify recovery times for Grit and from Penalties (the 2P need to be recovered with the normal Penalty recovery timeline)

[TODO] deal with the penalties - are they temp or added to pool



# Aiding Others

### **Lending a hand **

When simply contributing a PAMS attribute can be helpful. Where it makes sense, the supporting person can add their appropriate core attribute in support of the attempt. 

> _E.g. a simple physical test to lift a broken cart off of an injured person, both parties contribute their full Physical attribute to the pool. One roll is made for the pair working together to lift the cart against a target number of successes._

### **Working together or providing assistance**

In the case of two people are working on a problem, and where two can realistically contribute simultaneously. 
- Each can roll and their results are combined.
- Each receives the normal restistance/penalty dice
- And each person involved has **additional** 2Rd penalty resistance to reflect the overlapping efforts and complexity of collaboration.

### **Providing advice**

Where the supporting person has a higher skill (just skill, not PAMS + skill) than the person performing the test. The differences between the higher skill and the lower skill divided by two (round up) is added in risk dice.

> _E.g. A master (skill 4) provides advice to their student (skill 1), contributing 2R for the difference between their skill levels. The student could benefit significantly from the masters advice, although they could also fall foul of a misunderstanding reducing their understanding._

### **Adding to the drama** 

Assuming a reasonable narrative explanation can be made, anyone can contribute a drama die to any contest including ones that they are not involved in

# How to Recover?
### Recovering Penalty Dice

Penalties are recovered by sleep or serious rest. Each point requires 3 hours sleep to recover from. 
- If an age cap penalty exists, then the last point will take a full day of rest to recover from.

### Recovering Composure
Composure is recovered by restful calm without the stressful trigger circumstances. Relaxation can take many forms, and can be aided by external situation and/or influences (music, drink, drugs, sex, meditation etc)

-> 1 hour = current raised to max - current penalty - age penalty cap + external benefits

-> Each point after the 1st hour takes 2 hours to recover from  

### Recovering Grit
Grit is recovered by physically resting for an hour. Physical benefits can boost the recovery countering age or penalties (e.g. drink, drugs, energy bars, massage etc)

-> 1 hour = current raised to max - current penalty - age penalty cap + external benefits

-> Each point after the 1st hours takes 2 hours to recover from

* Do Penalty and Composure and Grit recover in parallel? -> yes
* Can't recover penalties caused by loss of Grit/Composure/infection until they have been recovered back to half or more.

### Recovering Flesh
Critical Flesh adds +1 month to the recovery time

### Recovering Fortitude
Fortitude is recovered through rest and calm contemplation. 

Once per story a character can make a narratively appropriate test to recover fortitude. Based on the actor level of the character, that many points per Story can be recovered through a narratively appropriate skill hard test, the recovery returns at 1 point per hour.

> _E.g. A monk encountering a ghost in the crypt of a church suffers the loss of 1 Fortitude. The monk, an 'Actor' can recover up to 2 points per Story. He decides to spend an hour in prayer at the Altar to calm himself. A successful Prayer test allows him to recover the lost point._

Other than this Fortitude takes 1 month per point to recover. This can happen during the summer but is more often recovered over the winter period.

### Recovering Drama Points
Drama Points are general recovered at the end of the Season.


# Drunkenness

After a period of indulgence and drinking to excess a state of drunkenness modifies personality traits, attribute pools and skill checks. The effects are broken into two tiers; Drunk and Very/Blind Drunk. Drunk is the 'normal' state of drunkenness after a period of indulgent drinking. Blind Drunk is only achieved after 'extreme' drinking and consumption.

**While drunk the following are all applied until the drunkenness passes;**

When drunk a character's courage and belief in themselves is exaggerated, at a cost of thinking straight and agility.

-   **Plus 1Dd dice for**;
	-   All social based skills
	-   And all Fortitude, Composure and Courage checks
	-   An additonal Temporary Trait e.g. Courage, Rash, Indulgent 
	-  A temporary +1Dd to any passion which is tested or called upon while drunk
-   **Plus 2Rd for everything else**;
	-   Knowledge based on Mental
	-   All Agility based skills
	-   Grit pool checks

**Blind Drunk/Very Drunk**

-   **Plus 2Dd for;**
-   Fortitude and Courage checks
-   Temporary +2 to Courage, Rash, Indulgent & optionally +2 exaggeration to any trait, bond or passion
-   **Plus 4Rd for everything else**… including Composure checks and social skills



**Mechanics: Drugged Drunkenness Variant**

[TODO] = Muses & creativity over social

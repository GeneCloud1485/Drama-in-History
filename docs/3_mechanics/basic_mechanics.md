# Types of Challenge Tests
A dynamic story will have many moments where the outcome is not clear, or that an actor's wishes are opposed and scenes which are challenging for the actor's to deal with.  These situations are dealt with through the use of a challenge test. There are a number of different forms of test, but they all work on same basic principle; build a pool, roll dice and read the results!

- Base Attribute Test
- Skill Tests
1. Unopposed Skill Test
2. Resisted Skill Test
3. Opposed Skill Test
- Currency Test
- Complex Test
- Combat, a deadly opposed test!

[TODO] Choosing appropriate skills and attributes. When to test & roll, and when not to... How many tests per scene?

## Success or Failure?
### Two Successes Needed
Tests take a number of forms and draw upon a variety of attributes, skills and factors, but ultimately the goal is the same - to achieve a net of TWO successes. Achieving two success is always enough to gain a base success, the difficulty of a test is handled via the additional of resistance dice or by an opposed roll. Gaining more than two successes is an indication of greater level of success, which in some circumstances can improve or expand on the success.

> E.g. 6 Base dice 6Bd {5,5,4,3,1,1} = 2 net successes 
> 
> or 5 Base dice and 2 Resistance dice 5Bd: {6,5,3,2,2}  & 2Rd: {2,2} = 0 net successes and a failure

### One success equals 'Yes, But...'
What about ONE success? It is close and triggers the option of a YES, BUT result if the character can pay a meaningful price to achieve a success. The penalty could be narrative, could be a currency costs (attribute pool) or the addition of a persistent penalty - this is determined in negotiation with the Director.

> E.g. 4 Base dice 4Bd: {5,2,2,1} = 1 net success requiring an additional price to be paid to succeed.

### Three '6s' is a Critical
A CRITICAL success is achieved when 3 or more "6"s are rolled in the Base or Drama dice pools. Count the total number of "6"s in the positive Base and Drama dice pool, and deduct the number of "1"s in the negative Resistance dice pool, the result is added to the number of successes total. A critical result in combat has an additional effect [TODO link]

> E.g. 7 Base dice and 4 Resistance dice
> 
>  7Bd: {6,6,6,5,3,3,1}  plus 4Pd: {4,4,2,1} creates an initial 2 net successes (4 positive and 2 negative). The 3 "6"s reveal a critical, which adds 2 (3-1) additional successes to the original result, bringing the final result to 4. 

Any critical results provide the Director adds a Tension Die to their Tension Pool. [TODO]

### Three '1s' cause Unintended Outcomes
A Unintended Outcomes happens when 3 or more '1s' are rolled in the Resistance pool result. Although it is likely that any test which has 3+ resistance successes will be unlikely to succeed, it isn't necessarily the case. Regardless of the success, the interesting point of an Unintended Outcome is to add in something more dramatic, challenging or trigger an inner struggle for the Actor.

> E.g 5 Base dice and 8 Resistance dice 5Bd {6,3,3,2,1} and 8Rd {6,5,5,3,2,1,1,1} is a net -3 successes, triggering an unintended outcome.
> 
> In this example the archer firing at the distant archery butt seriously misjudged the wind and sent their arrow flying wide. The arrow slammed into the wooden structure on which the notables of the fair were sitting, causing everyone to dive for cover!

It is theoretically possible to get both a Critical and Unintended Outcomes in the same result of the dice pool - time to get creative with the narrative outcomes!

#  **Base Attribute Test**
A simple attribute test is used as a basic and catch-all test, either opposed or unopposed. The pool is built from **double the attribute** + situational modifiers and penalty dice.

An attribute check can sometimes be used where there isn’t an applicable skills, but never in place of a skill. This test is based on one of the Phy Agl Men Soc attributes.

 >E.g. A cart wheel stuck in a rutted track, a straightforward challenge requiring 2 successes on a Physical attribute check. Young William puts his shoulder to the wheel and rolls his physical of 2 rolling 4Bd {4,3,3,1}

> He fails to move the cart and calls to his friend Peter of Lynn, who puts his shoulder to the other wheel and provides his 2 physical to help. The two roll (4 and 4) achieving 3 successes between them and they shove the cart free of the rut._

---

# **Skill Tests**
Skill tests can contain a number of combinations; single test, opposed, co-operative, multiple opponents and could consist of a single test or a series of tests.

For unopposed tests, calculate the dice pool and roll to determine the number of successes to compare with the target number.

For opposed tests, the parties calculate their dice pools and then compare the results to determine the levels of success.

For complex or co-operative tests, additional dice can be added to a pool from assisting parties, pools can be split against multiple opponents and the test can be a series of tests.

## Choice of Skill for the Test
The Director can ask for a specific skill test or an Actor can request a skill test based on a specific skill.

- The skill value is determined by the level of training, and are added to the appropriate attribute to get the base pool dice.

> E.g. An actor trained (+2) in Riding with an Agility of 3 will have a 5Bd

- If the attribute associated with the skill is lower than the value of the skill, and greater than zero then 1Rd resistance is added to the test.
- If the attribute associated with the skill is zero or lower, then 2Rd are added.

> E.g. An aging actor who is an accomplished (+3) Dancer, but now has an Agility of 2 will gain an additional 1Rd as well as their 5Bd for the skill + attribute.

> E.g. An accomplished (skill 3) hunter with an Agility of 3 and Mental of 2, attempts to shoot a deer and lay snares for a rabbit. Shooting is based on Agility, and the actor has a combined skill & attribute of 6. Setting snares is based on Mental, and the actor has a combined skill & attribute of 5, since the Mental is lower than the skill they also pick up 1Rd.

- Where an actor doesn't have a specific skill for a given situation, they can have a background can stand in if that background would reasonably have provide some experience in the skill test required.
- Up to three of the same background bands can be considered as skill training replacement. More than three doesn't add to the stand-in skill replacement.
- If the background can reasonably be considered as directly applicable then add 1Bd for each background.
	- Directly = one background for +1Bd, two for +2Bd, max of three for +3Bd
- If the background is too general, somewhat indirect or a stretch, add 1Rd for each Bd which is added.
	- Indirectly = one background 1Bd + 1Rd, two for +2Bd + 2Rd, max of three for +3Bd + 3Rd

> E.g.  The Director asks the player of a young monk who is sitting in the cloister watching a somewhat heated discussion between two fellow Brothers to make a 'Social Insight' test. The monk doesn't have the specific skill Insight, but can call upon their two backgrounds in Religious Life, since growing up in the Abbey he has given him a reasonable sense of what Brothers argue about. Two backgrounds count as 2Bd plus the Social attribute of 2, provides a base pool of 4Bd.

> E.g. if the actor has been a Journeyman Cloth Merchant, with two backgrounds in Guild Merchant Life, it would still have been possible to use the backgrounds for the Insight skill but only as indirectly appropriate. The actor would get their 2Bd Social plus 2Bd for the backgrounds, along with 2Rd for being indirectly appropriate. The additional resistance reflects the potential for jumping to conclusions or mis-reading the situation due to the different experiences of a Monk's life compared to a Cloth Merchant's life.

## *Levels of Difficulty*

Level of difficulty is reflected in the addition of penalty/resistance dice to the pool so that the target number is always 2 success to pass the test.

| Difficulty | Modifier | Example |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| Very Easy | +4Bd | An average person, untrained has a reasonable chance to succeed |
| Straightforward| +2Bd | An average person, trained in the skill should succeed most of the time|
| Some Difficulty | 0 | ...should succeed half of the time |
| Troublesome | 2Rd | ...will fail more than they succeed |
| Difficult | 4Rd | A master of the skill should succeed |
| Very Challenging | 6Rd | A master of the skill may fail more than they succeed |
| Extremely Hard | 8Rd | Even an expert of the skill may struggle with this challenge |
| Formidable | 10Rd | Likely to require a talented expert with advantages to succeed  |

## **Unopposed** Skill Tests
A simple unopposed test pits the skill of a person against the level of difficulty or resistance of a challenge.

Build a dice pool from Base, Resistance, and Drama dice.
1. **Base pool** = Attribute + Skill or background (capped by the attribute)
2. **Resistance pool** = persistent penalties + difficulty of the challenge + situational modifiers
3. **Drama pool** = risks, dramatic advantages or passions applicable

The pools are rolled and the number of net successes is calculated. If two or more net successes are achieved then the test is successful.

## **Resisted** Skill Tests 
A resisted skill test is used for where another person is being affected or influenced by the test, and so have a resistance to the skill. It is very similar to an unopposed skill test, with the addition of extra resistance from the targets stats or skills.

Build a dice pool from Base, Resistance, and Drama dice.
1. **Base pool** = Attribute + Skill or background (capped by the attribute)
2. **Resistance pool** = persistent penalties + difficulty of the challenge + situational modifiers + **the stat or skill of the target** in resistance
3. **Drama pool** = risks, dramatic advantages or passions applicable

The pools are rolled and the number of net successes is calculated. If two or more net successes are achieved then the test is successful.


## **Opposed** Skill Tests
An opposed skill test is used when someone is actively engaged in attempting to win a contest of some form. Each party will build dice pools, roll and compare the results. The winner is the person with the highest number of net successes as long as the result is greater than two.

Build a dice pool from Base, Resistance, and Drama dice.
1. **Base pool** = attribute + skill or background  (capped by the attribute)
2. **Resistance pool** = persistent penalties + situational modifiers
3. **Drama pool** = risks, dramatic advantages or passions applicable

Possible outcomes;
- **Winner**: One party achieves two or more net successes and greater than the other person.
- **Draw**: Both parties the same number of two or more net successes, leading to a draw. Draw will be resolved by who has momentum.
- **Failure**: Both parties fail to gain two net successes

> E.g. Two apprentices play marbles, the winner gets to ask the Master's daughter to accompany him for a walk by the river.
> 
> Each rolls Agl + 2bd for their Town Life backgrounds, and one adds 2Dd for his passion for the girl.
> 
> A: 5Bd {5,5,2,1,1} for net two successes vs B: 4Bd {5,3,2,2} + 2Dd {6,6,4,1} for net 3 successes
> 
> B wins the game of marbles, his passion drove him to throw a brave shot which paid off. A pleasant walk with his sweet heart awaits.

Momentum is determined by the person who won the 'last round' in a multi-round contest, or who has the highest appropriate attribute, or who has an advantage which can argued to influence the outcome.

### *Opposed Social Contests*

_Design Goals: To encourage role-playing in line with the characters and story for mechanical advantages in resolving a complex opposed contest. Imaginative, narrative and dramatic role-play on the part of the players should contribute 50% of the dice pool. In most cases, the NPCs should present brief narrative and character defense, but use their composure pool rather than the GM counter arguing for dice._

A social contest brings together narrative & role-play with skills & context into a complex opposed dice pool test. The scene should be setup by establishing the contest goal, then freeform role-play which brings the major advantages into play. After the role-play reaches an appropriate and dramatic point the pools are calculated and rolled to see the result. Each contest should be resolved in one test, although it is possible to keep the contest going if it is satisfactorily resolves, but the skill checks & advantages & narrative needs to be different in the second round.

# Currency Tests
The currency pools are Flesh, Grit, Composure and Fortitude. Each can be tested 

## Test of the Flesh Pool
Tested in a Courage Test when receiving a physical or painful injury to resist passing out. Or tested when resisting or recovering from a fever or sickness.

- nBd equals **Max Flesh pool** + nRd which is current persistent penalty dice + Flesh/Pain points incurred to trigger this test + any situational modifiers
> E.g. An actor with Flesh pool of 8 with 2 current persistent penalties takes a sword blow which inflicts 3 Flesh damage to them. The test would be 8Bd + 5Rd based on the 3pt Flesh wound and 2 persistent penalties.

Any appropriate traits or dramatic advantages could be added to the pool.

- Success: the test is passed 
- Yes, but: accept a persistent penalty dice to pass the test
- Failed: failed the test and passed out, adding a persistent penalty dice 

No double counting: The test only considers the current inflicted wound, as previous wounds will have potentially contributed persistent penalties which will be added into the test anyway.
- Courage Test
- Fever & sickness check

[TODO how long are you passed our for?]

---

## Test of the Grit Pool
- Reaction or 'save' style test

nBd is equal to **max Grit pool** + nRd from current persistent penalty dice + any situational modifiers

---

## Tests of Fortitude 
- Shock & Horror
- Scars

A test of fortitude is made whenever the character is faced with a strongly disturbing, shocking, horrific or scary situation. These can be the results of phobias, encounters with death, disease or horrors of the battle field, or engaging in mortal sins.

- nBD equals the **Max Fortitude pool** + nRd which is penalty + strength of the shock that triggered the test

**Strength of the shock sets the Resistance in Fortitude Tests**
- Shock 2Rd
- Horror 4Rd
- Trauma 6Rd
- Considering the amount at stake +2/4Rd
- Specific Empathy for the victim/situation 2Rd
- A Bond which connects to the victim/trigger 2Rd

Any appropriate traits or dramatic advantages could be added to the pool.

Outcomes;
- Success: the test is passed
- Yes, but: accept a persistent penalty dice to pass the test
- Failed: failed the test and passed out, adding a persistent penalty dice 
- Regardless of the outcome, lose one point of Fortitude for each success in the Resistance pool

 > E.g. A nervous priest is confronted by what he believes to be a ghost in the graveyard. He has a Fortitude of 6 and a trait of 'nervous" 1Rd, is carrying a persistent penalty from an earlier heated discussion with an angry scholar. The encounter is rated as a 2Rd shock.
 > 
 > The test is 6Bd {6,6,3,3,3,1} for +2 successes + 4Rd (2Rd for test + 1Rd for penalty + 1Rd for nervous) {4,3,3,2} for -1 success = one net success. 
 > 
 > The priest pays the price to pass the test by taking another penalty. He loses 1 point of Fortitude due to the single success of the resistance pool, and turns to flee. 
 > 
 > He is sorely shaken (the penalty) and will remember the chill of the graveyard for at least the next month while his Fortitude recovers.

#### **Loss of Fortitude**

Loss of Fortitude reflects a weakening of the mind, soul, or one's grasp of normality. 

- If Fortitude is under 50% a persistent penalty is applied until Fortitude is recovered to greater than 50%. This penalty can't be recovered by any other means.
- If a character's Fortitude is reduced to **zero** they are taken regarded as deranged, insane, enfeebled and unable to act meaningfully. They will be in this state until their Fortitude recovers a point.

[TODO] Lasting scars - is there a need to have a partial madness from loss in one story?
[TODO] risks of recovering from a zero Fort situation? 

[TODO] tracking FORT wounds by wound

Failing to succeed in a test of Fortitude leads to a an uncontrolled shock outcome [TODO is this too exaggerated?]

> E.g. A week later, the nervous priest is wandering in the woods and comes across a sight of slaughter, a deer carcass has been ritually laid out and clear signs of devil worship overwhelm the priests mind.

> He has had time to recover from the penalties he was carrying, but this encounter is shocking to him for both gruesome slaughter and the obvious signs of witchcraft. 

> The test is 6Bd {4,3,3,2,1,1} for no successes + 5Rd (nervous + 4Rd shocking horror) {6,6,4,2,2} for -2 successes + 2D (for his Religious Faith) {3,1} for -1 success. The test is failed with a net -3 successes

> The priest loses three points of Fortitude, taking him to below half and uncomfortably close to zero. He gains a persistent penalty for being under half Fortitude.

> For failing the test he triggers an uncontrollable shock effect, and adds another penalty dice. The widest number in the combined pools is 3 (there are three '3s' and three '1s', as '3' is the highest it is chosen). The priest rails against the situation, crying out in an emotional outpouring. He is unable to leave the scene, until his rage of emotion expires.

### **Uncontrolled Shock Effects**

Highest # of Results | Effect

6| Attempt to fight the source of the fear
5| Shout, rant and scream - incoherent, quoting biblical texts, speaking in tongues
4| Attempt to flee the scene, turn away and keep back to threat and be obsessed with leaving the scene
3| Emotional & passionate response - cry, wail, impassioned railing against the situation
2| Gag, vomit and freeze. Feel shortage of breath and hyper-tension.
1| Rock catatonic, immobile, unresponsive and vulnerable

[TODO] duration of effects, level of player agency throughout the episode?

---

## Tests of Composure
- Stress & Fear
- Social composure

Can be both a reaction and a pre test to establish the tone for RP

A test of composure is called when the character needs to keep their cool, deal with social status pressure, contain their anger or passion, deal with feelings of uncertainty or personal struggles, strange atmospheres, or outright fear.

These are unopposed single tests and are different than a social contest, the outcome of a composure check confirms the persons confidence in dealing with a situation and can apply penalties if failed. 

[TODO] - how to simplify composure into skill checks like this?

A composure check can be made before a subsequent test, but should aim to ask & resolve a different question and not just be a 'double' dice test.

_E.g. Checking composure before making a Lie skill check is not necessary, the lie skill check would be enough._

**Social failure effects**

Result | Effect

6| No additional effects
5| Exaggerated discomfort = double 'degree of failure' in composure loss
4| Emotional reaction, visible to all. Reduce an existing or gain a negative bond or passion
3| Sadness which lasts the 'degree of failure' in days
2| Dizziness & Nausea, additional +1 Penalty
1| A stress induced Scar +1

As well as any mechanical outcome the results should provide guidance on how to behave and informs role-playing.
> "You feel a lingering effect of the situation, this can be played out over the coming scene. Ideally these filter into your normal play rather than super clear moments which stand out as unique consequences. The effect will last for about an hour."


## Test of Luck
Roll 6Bd and 6Rd, the net success outcome indicates the level of luck or mis-fortune.

> E.g. 6Bd {6,4,4,3,2,2} vs 6Rd {6,6,4,2,1,1} = -2 net successes and a strongly unfortunate outcome.

It might be possible to apply Dramatic Advantages, scars or strengths - used sparingly. It is possible to spend Drama Points for get 2Dd. Or for the Director to spend 1 tension dice for 2 additional Rd.

---

# Complex Challenge Tests
Some problems are extremely complex, protracted and involved that a single test is not sufficient to resolve. In a case of a protracted challenge test the results of multiple rounds combine to measure progress overcoming a challenge.

Each complex test is unique and can allow different combinations of the cost of success and failure. The dimensions of the Complex Test may be transparent and clear to the actor, or it may be hidden, and only understood when earlier dimensions are resolved.

Resolving the Complex Test;
1. Tackle **each of the dimensions in turn**, each dimension can have a different resistance and cost
	1. Some dimensions are one attempt only
	2. Some have a cost for failure
	3. And others allow a second attempt with an alternate cost.
2. Success on a dimension **unlocks the next dimension**, and often will require a price to be paid. That cost could vary depending if it is the 1st or 2nd attempt.
4. On a second attempt, the resistance is generally 2Rd less
5. **Failure on the second attempt**, means that the dimension stays locked and the overall test has been failed. 

Failed Complex Tests can be potentially be re-attempted once something substantial about the actor(s) or the situation has changed - growth in skills, new teacher, significant time has passed.

The Director can set most anything as a price to be paid for success and/or failure. Some examples;
- Coin e.g. bribes or payments
- Specific resources or items e.g. Alchemical components
- Time e.g. time investment required
- Fortitude e.g. disturbing knowledge that is unsettling 
- Flesh e.g. a physical price to pay either an indirect consequence like a wound, or as a required contribution like a blood sacrifice...
- Creation or breaking of a bond e.g. membership of a fraternity, or shaking of a previously held faith
- Addition of a scar or strength e.g. confidence in their new knowledge, an actor gains a strength related to that knowlegde
- Boon or Flaw e.g. temporary good luck will follow the actor, gaining +1Bd on luck checks (6Bd vs 6Rd)

Successful resolution will achieve the outcome, in some circumstances due to failed tests a partial outcomes can be achieved. Like failed tests, a partial outcome can't be improved upon unless something significant has changed.

> Example - Attempting to read a complex book of arcane knowledge, the *Treatise on the Celestial Mind* or "Tractatus de Mente Coelesti".

> The book is an arcane tome with 3 dimensions of complexity which need to be unlocked to receive the wisdom and knowledge it contains.
> 
> The first dimension is Geometry, it is difficult to understand (10Rd) but has no price to pay for an initial success. Failure on the 1st attempt means paying the cost of failure (loss of 1 Fort point). A second attempt is allowed, and the subsequent attempt is a little easier (8Rd), but success on the second attempt will limit the total value of the whole test to a partial outcome. Failure on the 2nd attempt will incur another cost, and will block further progress until something substantial changes about the reader or their resources.

> The second dimension is Astronomy, the price for the 1st attempt is the passage of time (1 month), there is no additional cost of failure and a second attempt will take a further passage of time (2 months).

> The third dimension is Religion, this test is more of a revelation and no subsequent attempts are allowed. Success incurs a cost (loss of 1F) before unlocking the reward/outcome of the complex test. Failure will end the Test, and incurs a substantial cost (-3 Fortitude + test for a scar)

| Dimension | Resistance | Price on 1st attempt | Price on 2nd attempt | Cost of failure |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Geometry | 10Rd | n/a | Partial Outcome | -1 Fort |
| Astronomy | 8Rd | 1 month | 2 months | n/a | 
| Religion | 8Rd | -1 Fort |none allowed | -3 Fort^1 | 

> ^1 Test Fort pool or receive a scar 

> The result of the Complex Test is either a full or partial Outcome. 
> 
> In this case the full outcome provides Training level skill in 'Celestial Mind' and an awareness or faith in the interconnectedness of the celestial and the human condition. This creates a Bond, which is immediately taken and which challenges any bond of faith or religion which exists.  The existing bond of faith or religion must be tested or potentially broken...

> A partial outcome will create the bond and challenge existing bonds of faith without the training.

# **Penalty Dice**

Penalty dice generally represent persistent but temporary stress, pressure or disadvantage that a character is suffering from. They can be gained as a result of a number of actions or outcomes, and can be recovered by a combination of rest/time and the removal of the cause. They differ from a situational modifier, which would typically be applied for just one test or roll.

**Examples of persistent penalties;**

-   Fatigue - results of prolonged exposure, hunger/thirst etc or an exhausted pool of Grit
-   Fear or Morale - results of a failed Mortal Fear check
-   Uncertainty & Stress - resulting from failed awareness in stressful situation (exploring), before battle, in unknown territory with failed Country Life, failing a social roll under scrutiny
-   Discombobulated - lost of social contest
-   Drunk or drugged - excess consumption

The total pool adds penalty die equal to its current total to **all** skills, actions or tests, except trait checks. 

Occasionally it might be possible to convert a penalty to an advantage, but rolled as a risk

> _E.g. being somewhat drunk could be argued to be a bonus on some Social or Physical tests_

[TODO] penalty die as the price of failure

**Combined levels of penalty**

-   1-3 penalty = **distracted**
-   4-6 penalty = **shaken**
-   7-9 penalty = **stressed** with a constant reminder
-   10+ = leaves a character **broken** and unable to act effectively

Penalty dice are applied to all healing or recovery checks and will modify recovery times for Grit and from Penalties (the 2P need to be recovered with the normal Penalty recovery timeline)

[TODO] deal with the penalties - are they temp or added to pool

---

# Aiding Others

### **Lending a hand**

When simply contributing a PAMS attribute can be helpful. Where it makes sense, the supporting person can add their appropriate core attribute in support of the attempt. 

> _E.g. a simple physical test to lift a broken cart off of an injured person, both parties contribute their full Physical attribute to the pool. One roll is made for the pair working together to lift the cart against a target number of successes._

### **Working together or providing assistance**

In the case of two people are working on a problem, and where two can realistically contribute simultaneously. 
- Each can roll and their results are combined.
- Each receives the normal restistance/penalty dice
- And each person involved has **additional** 2Rd penalty resistance to reflect the overlapping efforts and complexity of collaboration.

### **Providing advice**

Where the supporting person has a higher skill (just skill, not PAMS + skill) than the person performing the test. The differences between the higher skill and the lower skill divided by two (round up) is added in risk dice.

> _E.g. A master (skill 4) provides advice to their student (skill 1), contributing 2R for the difference between their skill levels. The student could benefit significantly from the masters advice, although they could also fall foul of a misunderstanding reducing their understanding._

### **Adding to the drama** 

Assuming a reasonable narrative explanation can be made, anyone can contribute a drama die to any contest including ones that they are not involved in

---

# How to Recover?
### Recovering Penalty Dice

Penalties are recovered by sleep or serious rest. Each point requires 3 hours sleep to recover from. 
- If an age cap penalty exists, then the last point will take a full day of rest to recover from.

### Recovering Composure
Composure is recovered by restful calm without the stressful trigger circumstances. Relaxation can take many forms, and can be aided by external situation and/or influences (music, drink, drugs, sex, meditation etc)

-> 1 hour = current raised to max - current penalty - age penalty cap + external benefits

-> Each point after the 1st hour takes 2 hours to recover from  

### Recovering Grit
Grit is recovered by physically resting for an hour. Physical benefits can boost the recovery countering age or penalties (e.g. drink, drugs, energy bars, massage etc)

-> 1 hour = current raised to max - current penalty - age penalty cap + external benefits

-> Each point after the 1st hours takes 2 hours to recover from

* Do Penalty and Composure and Grit recover in parallel? -> yes
* Can't recover penalties caused by loss of Grit/Composure/infection until they have been recovered back to half or more.

### Recovering Flesh
Each point of each flesh damage taken in a wound takes a month to recover from. 

> E.g.  A merchant is stabbed while returning to the Inn late at night, he takes a 2 point Flesh wound before fighting off his assailant. The wound is deep but not life threatening, it will take a full two months to recover.

If an actor receives multiple wounds they recover in parallel.

> E.g. If the merchant has been stabbed a second time, this time for 1 point of Flesh, that would would heal during the first month of his two months recovery.

Critical Flesh wounds add two months to the recovery time for that wound.

> E.g. a man-at-arms receives a critical wound which causes 5 points of Flesh damage. The 1st three months of recovery heals 1 point of flesh, and then the remaining points are healed over a further four months. The man requires seven months to recover fully from his grievous wound.

### Recovering Fortitude
Fortitude is recovered through rest and calm contemplation. 

Once per story a character can make a narratively appropriate test to recover fortitude. Based on the actor level of the character, that many points per Story can be recovered through a narratively appropriate skill hard test, the recovery returns at 1 point per hour.

> _E.g. A monk encountering a ghost in the crypt of a church suffers the loss of 1 Fortitude. The monk, an 'Actor' can recover up to 2 points per Story. He decides to spend an hour in prayer at the Altar to calm himself. A successful Prayer test allows him to recover the lost point._

Other than this Fortitude takes 1 month per point to recover. This can happen during the summer but is more often recovered over the winter period.

### Recovering Drama Points
Drama Points are general recovered at the end of the Season.

# Drunkenness

After a period of indulgence and drinking to excess a state of drunkenness modifies personality traits, attribute pools and skill checks. The effects are broken into two tiers; Drunk and Very/Blind Drunk. Drunk is the 'normal' state of drunkenness after a period of indulgent drinking. Blind Drunk is only achieved after 'extreme' drinking and consumption.

**While drunk the following are all applied until the drunkenness passes;**

When drunk a character's courage and belief in themselves is exaggerated, at a cost of thinking straight and agility.

-   **Plus 1Dd dice for**;
	-  All social based skills
	-  And all Fortitude, Composure and Courage checks
	-  An additional Temporary Trait e.g. Courage, Rash, Indulgent 
	-  A temporary +1Dd to any passion which is tested or called upon while drunk
-   **Plus 2Rd for everything else**;
	- Knowledge based on Mental
	- Any context where being drunk is frowned upon

**Blind Drunk/Very Drunk**

-   **Plus 2Dd for;**
-   Fortitude and Courage checks
-   Temporary +2 to Courage, Rash, Indulgent & optionally +2 exaggeration to any trait, bond or passion
-   **Plus 4Rd for everything else**… including Composure checks and social skills


## Mechanics: Drugged Drunkenness Variant

[TODO] = Muses & creativity over social

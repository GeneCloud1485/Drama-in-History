# Types of Challenge Tests
A dynamic story will have many moments where the outcome is not clear, or that an actor's wishes are opposed, or scenes which are challenging for the actor's to deal with.  These situations are dealt with by the use of a challenge test. There are a number of different forms of test, but they all work on same basic principle; build a pool, roll dice and read the results!

- Base Attribute Tests [[#**Base Attribute Test**]]
- Skill Tests [[#**Skill Tests**]]
1. Unopposed Skill Test
2. Resisted Skill Test
3. Opposed Skill Test
- Currency Pool Test [[pool_tests]]
- Complex Test [[optional_mechanics]]
- Combat, a deadly opposed test! [[combat]]

The goal is to make each test meaningful, sometimes dramatic but always with something that matters to be resolved. This doesn't need to be life or death, and could be of quite a mundane nature, as long as it matters to the actors and their story.

Some groups may like to roll more frequently than others, this is personal preference. Since building a pool is a little more complex than roll a d20, it is generally good to pace yourselves with tests. 

Use the results of the pool to help make the roll more meaningful, let the pool help expand the narrative where appropriate.

## Success or Failure? 
- Two success are needed for success in an unopposed test
- Two success and more than the opponent are needed in an opposed test

# **Base Attribute Test**
A simple attribute test is used as a basic and catch-all test, either opposed or unopposed. Build the following pools;

1.  **Base pool** = Double the Attribute + situational modifiers
2. **Resistance pool** = persistent penalties + difficulty of the challenge + situational modifiers
3. **Drama pool** = risks, dramatic advantages or passions applicable

An attribute check can sometimes be used where there isn’t an applicable skills, but never in place of a skill. This test is based on one of the Physical, Agility, Mental, Social attributes.

 >E.g. A cart wheel stuck in a rutted track, a challenge with some difficulty requiring 2 successes on a Physical attribute check. He has no penalties, there is no modifiers and the difficulty of the task is 0. Young William puts his shoulder to the wheel with his physical attribute of 2 he rolls 4Bd {4,3,3,1}

> He fails to move the cart and calls to his friend Peter of Lynn, who puts his shoulder to the other wheel and provides his 2 physical to help. The two roll (4 and 4) achieving 3 successes between them and they shove the cart free of the rut.

# **Skill Tests**
Skill tests can contain a number of combinations; single test, opposed, co-operative, multiple opponents and could consist of a single test or a series of tests.

For unopposed tests, calculate the dice pool and roll to determine the number of successes to compare with the target number.

For opposed tests, the parties calculate their dice pools and then compare the results to determine the levels of success.

For complex or co-operative tests, additional dice can be added to a pool from assisting parties, pools can be split against multiple opponents and the test can connected to create a series of tests.

## Choice of Skill for the Test
The Director can ask for a specific skill test or an Actor can request a skill test based on a specific skill.

- The **skill value** is determined by the level of training, and are added to the **appropriate attribute** to get the base pool dice.

> E.g. An actor trained (+2) in Riding with an Agility of 3 will have a 5Bd

- If the attribute associated with the skill is half or less than the value of the skill, and greater than zero then 1Rd resistance is added to the test.
- If the attribute associated with the skill is zero or lower, then 2Rd are added.

> E.g. An aging actor who is an accomplished (+3) Dancer, but now has an Agility of 2 will gain an additional 1Rd as well as their 5Bd for the skill + attribute.

> E.g. An accomplished (skill 3) hunter with an Agility of 3 and Mental of 2, attempts to shoot a deer and lay snares for a rabbit. Shooting is based on Agility, and the actor has a combined skill & attribute of 6. Setting snares is based on Mental, and the actor has a combined skill & attribute of 5, since the Mental is lower than the skill they also pick up 1Rd.

- Where an actor doesn't have a specific skill for a given situation, they can have a background  stand in if that background would reasonably have provide some experience in the skill test required.
- Up to three of the same background bands can be considered as skill training replacement. More than three doesn't add to the stand-in skill replacement. 
- If the background can reasonably be considered as directly applicable then add 1Bd for each background.
	- Directly = one background for +1Bd, two for +2Bd, max of three for +3Bd
- If the background is too general, somewhat indirect or a stretch, add 1Rd for each Bd which is added.
	- Indirectly = one background 1Bd + 1Rd, two for +2Bd + 2Rd, max of three for +3Bd + 3Rd
- As with skills, if the number of backgrounds counted is higher than the attribute add 1Rd, and if the attribute is zero or lower add 2Rd

> E.g.  The Director asks the player of a young monk who is sitting in the cloister watching a somewhat heated discussion between two fellow Brothers to make a 'Social Insight' test. The monk doesn't have the specific skill Insight, but can call upon their two backgrounds in Religious Life, since growing up in the Abbey he has given him a reasonable sense of what Brothers argue about. Two backgrounds count as 2Bd plus the Social attribute of 2, provides a base pool of 4Bd.

> E.g. if the actor has been a Journeyman Cloth Merchant, with two backgrounds in Guild Merchant Life, it would still have been possible to use the backgrounds for the Insight skill but only as indirectly appropriate. The actor would get their 2Bd Social plus 2Bd for the backgrounds, along with 2Rd for being indirectly appropriate. The additional resistance reflects the potential for jumping to conclusions or mis-reading the situation due to the different experiences of a Monk's life compared to a Cloth Merchant's life.

## *Levels of Difficulty*

Level of difficulty is reflected in the addition of penalty/resistance dice to the pool so that the target number is always 2 success to pass the test.

| Difficulty | Modifier | Example |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| Very Easy | +4Bd | An average person, untrained has a reasonable chance to succeed |
| Straightforward| +2Bd | An average person, trained in the skill should succeed most of the time|
| Some Difficulty | 0 | ...should succeed half of the time |
| Troublesome | 2Rd | ...will fail more than they succeed |
| Difficult | 4Rd | A master of the skill should succeed |
| Very Challenging | 6Rd | A master of the skill may fail more than they succeed |
| Extremely Hard | 8Rd | Even an expert of the skill may struggle with this challenge |
| Formidable | 10Rd | Likely to require a talented expert with advantages to succeed  |

## **Unopposed** Skill Tests
A simple unopposed test pits the skill of a person against the level of difficulty or resistance of a challenge.

Build a dice pool from Base, Resistance, and Drama dice.
1. **Base pool** = Attribute + Skill or background
2. **Resistance pool** = persistent penalties + difficulty of the challenge + situational modifiers
3. **Drama pool** = risks, dramatic advantages or passions applicable

Remember that in all skill tests if the Attribute is lower than the Skill, add 1Rd. If the attribute is zero or lower, add 2Rd.

The pools are rolled and the number of net successes is calculated. If two or more net successes are achieved then the test is successful.

## **Resisted** Skill Tests 
A resisted skill test is used for where another person is being affected or influenced by the test, and so have a resistance to the skill. It is very similar to an unopposed skill test, with the addition of extra resistance from the targets stats or skills.

Build a dice pool from Base, Resistance, and Drama dice.
1. **Base pool** = Attribute + Skill or background
2. **Resistance pool** = persistent penalties + difficulty of the challenge + situational modifiers + **the stat or skill of the target** in resistance
3. **Drama pool** = risks, dramatic advantages or passions applicable

The pools are rolled and the number of net successes is calculated. If two or more net successes are achieved then the test is successful.

## **Opposed** Skill Tests
An opposed skill test is used when someone is actively engaged in attempting to win a contest of some form. Each party will build dice pools, roll and compare the results. The winner is the person with the highest number of net successes as long as the result is greater than two.

Build a dice pool from Base, Resistance, and Drama dice.
1. **Base pool** = attribute + skill or background 
2. **Resistance pool** = persistent penalties + situational modifiers
3. **Drama pool** = risks, dramatic advantages or passions applicable

Possible outcomes;
- **Winner**: One party achieves two or more net successes and greater than the other person.
- **Draw**: Both parties the same number of two or more net successes, leading to a draw. Draw will be resolved by who has momentum.
- **Failure**: Both parties fail to gain two net successes

> E.g. Two apprentices play marbles, the winner gets to ask the Master's daughter to accompany him for a walk by the river.
> 
> Each rolls Agl + 2bd for their Town Life backgrounds, and one adds 2Dd for his passion for the girl.
> 
> A: 5Bd {5,5,2,1,1} for net two successes vs B: 4Bd {5,3,2,2} + 2Dd {6,6,4,1} for net 3 successes
> 
> B wins the game of marbles, his passion drove him to throw a brave shot which paid off. A pleasant walk with his sweet heart awaits.

Momentum is determined by the person who won the 'last round' in a multi-round contest, or who has the highest appropriate attribute, or who has an advantage which can argued to influence the outcome.

The skills chosen don't need to be the same, sometimes the appropriate skill is not the same one that the initiating party is calling up. 

> E.g. an angry woman suddenly attempts to slap an unsuspecting man standing in her way. She uses her Brawling skill and the defender uses awareness to avoid being caught by surprise. [todo - needs some tweaking]

### *Opposed Social Contests*

_Design Goals: To encourage role-playing in line with the characters and story for mechanical advantages in resolving a complex opposed contest. Imaginative, narrative and dramatic role-play on the part of the players should contribute 50% of the dice pool. In most cases, the NPCs should present brief narrative and character defense, but use their composure pool rather than the GM counter arguing for dice._

A social contest brings together narrative & role-play with skills & context into a complex opposed dice pool test. The scene should be setup by establishing the contest goal, then freeform role-play which brings the major advantages into play. After the role-play reaches an appropriate and dramatic point the pools are calculated and rolled to see the result. Each contest should be resolved in one test, although it is possible to keep the contest going if it is satisfactorily resolves, but the skill checks & advantages & narrative needs to be different in the second round.

# **Penalty Dice**
Penalty dice generally represent persistent but temporary stress, pressure or disadvantage that a character is suffering from. They can be gained as a result of a number of actions or outcomes, and can be recovered by a combination of rest/time and the removal of the cause. They differ from a situational modifier, which would typically be applied for just one test or roll.

**Examples of persistent penalties;**

- Fatigue - results of prolonged exposure, hunger/thirst etc or an exhausted pool of Grit
- Fear or Morale - results of a failed Mortal Fear check
- Paying the price to convert a 'Yes and but' single success into two successes
- Uncertainty & Stress - resulting from failed awareness in stressful situation (exploring), before battle, in unknown territory with failed Country Life, failing a social roll under scrutiny
- Discombobulated - lost of social contest
- Drunk or drugged - excess consumption

The total pool adds penalty die equal to its current total to **all skills, actions or tests**

Occasionally it might be possible to convert a penalty to an advantage, but rolled as a risk

> E.g. being somewhat drunk could be argued to be a bonus on some Social or Physical tests

**Combined levels of penalty**

-   1-3 penalty = **distracted**
-   4-6 penalty = **shaken**
-   7-9 penalty = **stressed** with a constant reminder
-   10+ = leaves a character **broken** and unable to act effectively

Penalty dice are applied to all healing or recovery checks and will modify recovery times for Grit and from Penalties (the 2P need to be recovered with the normal Penalty recovery timeline)

[TODO] deal with the penalties - are they temp or added to pool

# Aiding Others

### **Lending a hand**

Where it makes sense, the supporting person can add their appropriate core attribute in support of the attempt. 

> _E.g. a simple physical test to lift a broken cart off of an injured person, both parties contribute their full Physical attribute to the pool. One roll is made for the pair working together to lift the cart against a target number of successes._

### **Working together or providing assistance**

In the case of two people are working on a problem, and where two can realistically contribute simultaneously. 
- Each can roll and their results are combined, including any net negative successes
- Each receives the full normal resistance/penalty dice 

> E.g. Two apprentices working on a Difficult 4Rd problem set by their Master. They each have skill of 2Bd, one  has a Attribute of 3 and the other 2. They tests will be 4Bd vs 4Rd and 5Bd vs 4Rd, and the net successes combined.

> E.g. Example one; {5,5,3,1} vs {4,4,3,1} = net 1 plus {6,6,4,3,1,1} vs {6,5,3,2} = net 1 which combine to net two successes

> E.g. Example two; {6,5,2,2} vs {5,2,1,1} = net -1 plus {5,5,4,1,1} vs {6,4,4,3} = net 2 which combine for a net 1 success. The 1st apprentice misdirects and confuses the pair such that they fail to clearly resolve the challenge set by their Master.

### **Adding to the drama** 

Assuming a reasonable narrative explanation can be made, anyone can contribute a drama die to any contest including ones that they are not involved in

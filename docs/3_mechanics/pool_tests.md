# Tests of the Currency Pools
The currency pools are Flesh, Grit, Composure and Fortitude. Each can be tested .

### Tests of Flesh
- Courage after taking a flesh wound
- Fighting infection and fevers

### Tests of Grit
- Reactions

### Tests of Fortitude
- Supernatural - devils, demons, sorcerers
- Horror - battle, bodies, wounds, torture
- Escalated Composure checks due to Scars

### Tests of Composure
- Tension - risks, threat or dangerous situations
- Stresses - of sins, 
- Fears - ghosts, phobia, disease
- Social composure


[TODO WIP notes]
- All test rolled at Max Pool value
- Expecting Composure and Grit to drop more quickly
	- Losing Composure and Grit when at zero -> ==1/2 passed through to next level== or 100% up to 3 max?
- Test with 'Difficulty' in Rd, and lose 'Difficulty' - number of successes from pool
	- E.g. A tense situation which could lead to violence tests Composure with 4Rd. The number of 4 - success will be removed from pool.
- There will always be an Rd modifier on Composure and Fort checks


## Test of the Flesh Pool
Tested in a Courage Test when receiving a physical or painful injury to resist passing out. Or tested when resisting or recovering from a fever or sickness.

- Pool of nBd equals **Max Flesh** + nRd from current persistent penalty dice + Flesh/Pain points incurred to trigger this test + any situational modifiers

> E.g. An actor with Flesh pool of 8 with 2 current persistent penalties takes a sword blow which inflicts 3 Flesh damage to them. The test would be 8Bd + 5Rd based on the 3pt Flesh wound and 2 persistent penalties.

Any appropriate traits or dramatic advantages could be added to the pool.

- Success: the test is passed 
- Failed: failed the test and passed out, adding a persistent penalty dice 

Once an actor is passed out, they stay out until at lest the end of the scene. There are circumstance where the actor can recover their senses;
- Receive medical aid
- Receive a stimulant which brings them into consciousness
- By spending a drama point to recover

Waiting from being passed out doesn't change injuries or bleeding conditions.

No double counting: The test only considers the current inflicted wound, as previous wounds will have potentially contributed persistent penalties which will be added into the test anyway.
- Courage Test
- Fever & sickness check

### Incapacitated State
When an actor has zero or lower flesh they are considered incapacitated, and unable to act.

---

## Test of the Grit Pool
- Reaction or 'save' style test

nBd is equal to **max Grit pool** + nRd from current persistent penalty dice + any situational modifiers

### Blown State
An actor is considered blown when they have no Grit remaining. They are slower to react, winded or out of luck. They gain +1Rd persistent penalty until they recover some grit to move out of the blown state.

---

## Tests of Fortitude 

A test of fortitude is made whenever the character is faced with a strongly disturbing, shocking, horrific or scary situation. These can be the results of phobias, encounters with death, the super natural, disease or horrors of the battle field, or engaging in mortal sins.

- nBD equals the **Max Fortitude pool** + nRd from any current persistent penalties + strength of the shock that triggered the test

Strength of the shock sets the resistance in Fortitude Tests, and determines the loss of Fortitude

| Test | Resistance | Outcome Fort Loss|
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Shock | 0 | 2 - net successes |
| Horror | 2Rd | 3 - net successes |
| Trauma | 4Rd | 4 - net successes |
| Extreme Trauma | 6Rd | 5 - net successes

The test is modified by the actor's scars, strength, bonds and context;
- Considering the amount at stake +2/4Rd
- Specific Empathy for the victim/situation 2Rd
- A Bond which connects to the victim/trigger 2Rd
- A Scar or Strength which helps of hinders the test

> E.g. A villager collecting firewood discovers a beaten and bloodied body beneath a pile of leaves. The horror of seeing an unexpected and brutal death triggers a Fort test.  The villager has a max Fort of 5 vs the 2Rd from the horror of the situation, they roll {6,5,2,2,1} vs {6,3} for a net 2 success, and loss of (base of 3) - (2 successes) 1 point of Fort.

### **Loss of Fortitude**

Loss of Fortitude reflects a weakening of the mind, soul, or one's grasp of normality. 

- If Fortitude **reduced by 3 pts or more**, the actor faces an uncontrolled shock moment 
- If Fortitude is reduced *to* 50% of max, the actor gains +1Rd persistent penalty.
- If Fortitude is reduced *by* 50% of Max in one event, the actor takes on a lasting scar reflecting the situation.
- If an actor's Fortitude is reduced to **zero** they are 'Broken'.
- If Fortitude is reduced to -3 the actor is permanently and irrevocably insane.

#### Broken State
When an actor has zero Fortitude remaining they are regarded as deranged, insane, enfeebled and unable to act meaningfully. They will be in this state until their Fortitude recovers a point. In most situations this will mean that they out of the current story.

#### Uncontrolled Failure of Fortitude

If the actor is shocked to the point of losing control of the normal grasp of reality and sense, they can role play the consequence based on the actor's scars, traits and context. Or the pool can be reviewed to provide guidance.

|Width (highest # of Results) | Effect/Outcome |
| :--- | :---|
|6 | Attempt to fight the source of the fear |
|5 | Shout, rant and scream - incoherent, quoting biblical texts, speaking in tongues |
|4 | Attempt to flee the scene, turn away and keep back to threat and be obsessed with leaving the scene |
|3 | Emotional & passionate response - cry, wail, impassioned railing against the situation |
|2 | Gag, vomit and freeze. Feel shortage of breath and hyper-tension. |
|1 | Rock catatonic, immobile, unresponsive and vulnerable |

The effects of uncontrolled shock last the duration of the scene, or until the source of the shock is removed and calm, safety and care can be resumed.


[TODO update this example]

> E.g. A week later, the nervous priest is wandering in the woods and comes across a sight of slaughter, a deer carcass has been ritually laid out and clear signs of devil worship overwhelm the priests mind.

> He has had time to recover from the penalties he was carrying, but this encounter is shocking to him for both gruesome slaughter and the obvious signs of witchcraft. 

> The test is 6Bd {4,3,3,2,1,1} for no successes + 5Rd (nervous + 4Rd shocking horror) {6,6,4,2,2} for -2 successes + 2Dd (for his Religious Faith) {3,1} for -1 success. The test is failed with a net -3 successes

> The priest loses three points of Fortitude, taking him to below half and uncomfortably close to zero.

> For failing the test he triggers an uncontrollable shock effect, and adds another penalty dice. The widest number in the combined pools is 3 (there are three '3s' and three '1s', as '3' is the highest it is chosen). The priest rails against the situation, crying out in an emotional outpouring. He is unable to leave the scene, until his rage of emotion expires.

## Tests of Composure

A test of composure is called when the character needs to keep their cool, deal with social status pressure, contain their anger or passion, deal with feelings of uncertainty or personal struggles, strange atmospheres, or outright fear.

- nBD equals the **Max Fortitude pool** + nRd from any current persistent penalties + strength of the shock that triggered the test

| Test | Resistance | Outcome Fort Loss|
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Worry & Unease | 0 | 2 - net successes |
| Tension | 2Rd | 3 - net successes |
| Fear | 4Rd | 4 - net successes |
| Extreme Fear | 6Rd | 5 - net successes

The test is modified by the context, what is at stake and the actor's bonds or scars & strengths;
- Considering the amount at stake +2/4Rd
- Specific Empathy for the victim/situation 2Rd
- A Bond which connects to the victim/trigger 2Rd
- A Scar or Strength which helps of hinders the test

### Loss of Composure

- The net outcome reduces the current Composure pool
	- If this loss of 50% of max Composure in a single event leads to an Uncontrolled Failure of Composure
	- If this loss reduces the actor's composure to 0, they are in a Shaken State
	- Any remaining loss of composure will pass on to Fortitude up to a maximum of 3 points.

> E.g. a city private detective has been on the trail of a potential brutal serial killer, who they believe has kidnapped a child. They have tracked the killer through a misty pine forest, losing composure as the tension of their situation sinks in;  alone, mist reducing their visibility, unfamiliar sounds of the forest, along with the threat of the killer themself. 

> The detective (Composure 2 remaining from a pool 7), stepping into the overground yard scaring a pheasant to flap loudly into the air, and spotting charcoal markings on the cobbled floor. The markings have an occult quality, appear to be marked with the twisted and town corpses of chicken, splashes of blood splatter the floor. Booted footprints lead into the dark farm house... making a Fear composure check. 

> Composure check 9Bd vs 7Rd {6,5,5,4,4,4,4,2,1} for 3 successes vs {6,6,3,3,2,1,1} for 3 success = net zero. Fear causes 4 - 0 net successes = 4 loss of composure.
- Composure 7Bd + Strength: Determined 2Bd = 9Bd
- vs Fear 4Rd + Context, 'potentially' a child's life at stake 2Rd + a persistent penalty of 1Rd = 7Rd

> The detective should lose 4 composure, since they only have 2 points remaining 2 pass through to Fortitude. Their Composure is reduced to 0 and their Fortitude is reduced by 2. Also, as 4 points lost is greater than 50% of their max composure they take an uncontrolled Failure of Composure effect, and a 0 Composure leaves them in a Shaken State. 

> The width of the base dice pool determines the outcome. In this case, {6,5,5,4,4,4,4,2,1}, there are more 4's indicating that the detective suffers an emotional reaction. Perhaps a flashback reminds them of the child they are attempting to save, creating a new bond of care for the child. If they fail to save the child, they will gain a permanent Scar. They have to take a moment of pause, to compose themselves and wipe a tear from their eyes before moving on.

### Uncontrolled Failure of Composure

|Width (highest # of Results) | Effect/Outcome|
|:---|:---|
|6| No additional effects
|5| Exaggerated discomfort = double 'degree of failure' in composure loss
|4| Emotional reaction, visible to all. Gain or reduce a bond or belief which is under threat or perceived negative to the actor
|3| Deep Sadness which lasts the 'degree of failure' in days
|2| Physical side effects. Dizziness & Nausea, +1 Rd persistent penalty
|1| Scarred, immediately lose 1 Fortitude point, and if the scene warrants take a Scar

### Shaken State

When an actor has 0 composure remaining they are in a Shaken State.

- + 1Rd persistent penalty while they are Shaken
- While Shaken an actor will find it hard to make quick decisions and maintain their confidence 
- The Shaken State is removed once Composure is raised above 0

As well as any mechanical outcome the results should provide guidance on how to behave and informs role-playing.
> "You feel a lingering effect of the situation, this can be played out over the coming scene. Ideally these filter into your normal play rather than super clear moments which stand out as unique consequences. The effect will last for about an hour."


[TODO] Can be both a reaction and a pre test to establish the tone for RP. 
These are unopposed single tests and are different than a social contest, the outcome of a composure check confirms the persons confidence in dealing with a situation and can apply penalties if failed. 
[TODO] - how to simplify composure into skill checks like this?
A composure check can be made before a subsequent test, but should aim to ask & resolve a different question and not just be a 'double' dice test.
_E.g. Checking composure before making a Lie skill check is not necessary, the lie skill check would be enough._

[TODO updated example as ghost should be a composure check...]

 > E.g. A nervous priest is confronted by what he believes to be a ghost in the graveyard. He has a Fortitude of 6 and a trait of 'nervous" 1Rd, is carrying a persistent penalty from an earlier heated discussion with an angry scholar. The encounter is rated as a 2Rd shock.
 > 
 > The test is 6Bd {6,6,3,3,3,1} for +2 successes + 4Rd (2Rd for test + 1Rd for penalty + 1Rd for nervous) {4,3,3,2} for -1 success = one net success. 
 > 
 > The priest pays the price to pass the test by taking another penalty. He loses 1 point of Fortitude due to the single success of the resistance pool, and turns to flee. 
 > 
 > He is sorely shaken (the penalty) and will remember the chill of the graveyard for at least the next month while his Fortitude recovers.

# How to Recover?
### Recovering Penalty Dice

Penalties are recovered by sleep or serious rest. Each point requires 3 hours sleep to recover from. 
- If an age cap penalty exists, then the last point will take a full day of rest to recover from.

### Recovering Composure
Composure is recovered by restful calm without the stressful trigger circumstances. Relaxation can take many forms, and can be aided by external situation and/or influences (music, drink, drugs, sex, meditation etc)

-> 1 hour = current raised to max - current penalty - age penalty cap + external benefits

-> Each point after the 1st hour takes 2 hours to recover from  

### Recovering Grit
Grit is recovered by physically resting for an hour. Physical benefits can boost the recovery countering age or penalties (e.g. drink, drugs, energy bars, massage etc)

-> 1 hour = current raised to max - current penalty - age penalty cap + external benefits

-> Each point after the 1st hours takes 2 hours to recover from

* Do Penalty and Composure and Grit recover in parallel? -> yes
* Can't recover penalties caused by loss of Grit/Composure/infection until they have been recovered back to half or more.

### Recovering Flesh
Each point of each flesh damage taken in a wound takes a month to recover from. 

> E.g.  A merchant is stabbed while returning to the Inn late at night, he takes a 2 point Flesh wound before fighting off his assailant. The wound is deep but not life threatening, it will take a full two months to recover.

If an actor receives multiple wounds they recover in parallel.

> E.g. If the merchant has been stabbed a second time, this time for 1 point of Flesh, that would would heal during the first month of his two months recovery.

Critical Flesh wounds add two months to the recovery time for that wound.

> E.g. a man-at-arms receives a critical wound which causes 5 points of Flesh damage. The 1st three months of recovery heals 1 point of flesh, and then the remaining points are healed over a further four months. The man requires seven months to recover fully from his grievous wound.

### Recovering Fortitude
Fortitude is recovered through rest and calm contemplation. 

Once per story a character can make a narratively appropriate test to recover fortitude. Based on the actor level of the character, that many points per Story can be recovered through a narratively appropriate skill hard test, the recovery returns at 1 point per hour.

> _E.g. A monk encountering a ghost in the crypt of a church suffers the loss of 1 Fortitude. The monk, an 'Actor' can recover up to 2 points per Story. He decides to spend an hour in prayer at the Altar to calm himself. A successful Prayer test allows him to recover the lost point._

Other than this Fortitude takes 1 month per point to recover. This can happen during the summer but is more often recovered over the winter period.

### Recovering Drama Points
Drama Points are general recovered at the end of the Season.

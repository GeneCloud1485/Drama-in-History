# **Penalty Dice**

Penalty dice generally represent persistent but temporary stress, pressure or disadvantage that a character is suffering from. They can be gained as a result of a number of actions or outcomes, and can be recovered by a combination of rest/time and the removal of the cause. They differ from a situational modifier, which would typically be applied for one test or roll.

**Examples of persistent penalties;**

-   Fatigue - results of prolonged exposure, hunger/thirst etc or an exhausted pool of Grit
-   Fear or Morale - results of a failed Mortal Fear check
-   Uncertainty & Stress - resulting from failed awareness in stressful situation (exploring), before battle, in unknown territory with failed Country Life, failing a social roll under scrutiny
-   Discombobulated - lost of social contest
-   Drunk or drugged - excess consumption

The total pool adds penalty die equal to its current total to **all** skills, actions or tests, except trait checks.Â 

Occasionally it might be possible to convert a penalty to an advantage, but rolled as a risk

> _E.g. being somewhat drunk could be argued to be a bonus on some Social or Physical tests_

[TODO] penalty die as the price of failure

**Combined levels of penalty**

-   1-3 penalty = **distracted**
-   4-6 penalty = **shaken**
-   7-9 penalty = **stressed** with a constant reminder
-   10+ = leaves a character **broken** and unable to act effectively

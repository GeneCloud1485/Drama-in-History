# Creating Your Actor
[TODO - explanation of sequence here...]
1. Choose some key factors that made up your actor's **formative years**.
2. Establish their initial **Boon & Flaw**
3. Choose a **favored and dis-favored** attribute
4. Decide on the actor's **current age** and background
5. Work through the **actor's past** up to their current age
6. Generate the **currency** pools
7.  Fill out contacts and possessions

# 1. Formative Years
The 1st two age bands, baby & child, which take your actor through to age 10. This will deal with your family situation and early years, customized to be in keeping with the game setting, period, and Director's guidance.

1. Choose a family context - father & mother's position, status, standing, relative wealth and family outline.
2. Choose Urban or Country life as the 1st background 
3. Decide on your actor's 'Start in Life' that is in keeping with the family background and your character concept. Were their early years;
	3. Worldly, Secular or Pastoral? <- so what?
	4. Rich or Poor?  - determines the tone of your childhood <- so what?
	5. Loving, dramatic, hated or insignificant?  - establish a childhood bond, or add a scar?
	6. Uneducated or Educated? - If educated roll 8Bd each success is a skill point of basic knowledge skills. If uneducated roll 8Bd each success is a common skill point.
	7. Healthy or Sickly - test your luck (roll 6Bd and 6Rd), if net result is a positive +1 to an attribute, if negative then -1 to an attribute otherwise no effect.
4. Roll for and allocate the core attribute points
	1. Allocate 3 + net successes from 2Dd to the core attributes

> E.g. 3 + 2Dd {4,2} = 4 net successes. Allocated 1 to Physical, none to Agility, 1 to Mental, and 2 to Social

# 2. Boons & Flaws
Each actor has inherent boons or flaws which could for formative factors in their life story. 

## Boons

Adjust or adapt to fit an actor's story if the Director agrees.

# 3. Favored and Disfavored Attribute
Choose one of the four attributes to be favored and one which is dis-favored. 
A favored attribute is easier to raise to a higher value, and a dis-favored attribute is harder to raise to a higher value.

[[3. Core Attributes]]

# 4. Current Age & Background
Choose a current age for your actor, and mark which age bands are part of their history.

Agree with the director the background for your actor.

# 5. An Actor's Past
To develop your actor's background follow each of the following steps for **each of the age bands up to their current one**. Starting with the age band after 'Child' up to the current age band, follow these steps;
- A.  Roll for the addition or loss of core attribute points
- B. Assign these points, remembering to take into account your favored and dis-favored attributes
- C. Decide on a background
- D. Calculate the skill points
- E. Spend those skill points on skill
- F. Decide if there are any major or narrative events which happened during this period, generate bonds, traits, dramatic advantages or create scars or strengths accordingly.
- G. Agree on their current situation, occupation and location. Use this to determine their **starting resources** including their social status.

## A.  Additional Attribute Points

|Age Band|Which Attributes|Fixed|Risk|Base|Aging P or A|Age M or S|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Child|PAMS|3|2Dd|0|||
|Juvenile|PAMS|3|2Dd|0|||
|Youth|PAMS|2|1Dd|1Bd|1Rd||
|Prime|PAMS|1|1Dd|1Bd|1Rd||
|Adult|PAMS|1|0|1Bd|1Rd||
|Mature|PAMS|1|0|1Bd|2Rd|1Rd|
|Veteran|MS|0|0|1Bd|2Rd|1Rd|
|Senior|MS|0|0|1Bd|3Rd|2Rd|
|Aged|MS|0|0|1Bd|4Rd|2Rd|
|Elderly| | | | |4Rd|4Rd|

## B. Assign Point to Attributes
Costs to increase an attribute by a point

|Normal| Favored | Dis-favored|
|---|---|---|
| 1-4 = 1 pt | 1-5 = 1pt | 1-3 = 1 pt |
| 5+ = 2 pts | 6+ = 2 pts | 4+ = 2 pts |

## C. Decide on a Background for the Age Band
For each Age Band choose how your Actor spent the focus of their time during this Age Band.

### Background
A background provides a summary of the main occupation or emphasis of a period of time in the actor's past.

## D. Calculate Skill Points & Skills Available
There are three sources of skill points; from life's general lessons, from vocational opportunities or through academic study. Skills points are only gained from Juvenile to Veteran.

1. Life's lessons, each year that passes in an age band provides one point to be used on common skills.
2. Vocational opportunities, each years of an age band provides one point to be use on common or vocational skills
3. Optional academic study, is limited to total of three age bands and provides ten points per age band.

### Developing Common Skills
Everyone can learn, practice or improve their training level in common skills, no particular background situation is required to progress.

> E.g. In a medieval setting, the 'mature' age band is 5 years long and provides 5 points to spend on common skills

### Leaning Speciality Vocational Skills
The setting and era will determine how many additional skill points are available to an actor from an age band. Each year provides one point that can be spent on common or specialist vocational skills. These points can only be spent on skills which align with the actor's profession and opportunity during this age band.

> E.g. If the actor was able to gain vocational training or through simple re-enforcement of core skills, or had free time to invest in skill development then they gain additional points to spend on more expert or knowledge skills.

> E.g. A mature actor serving in King Richard II's court gains 5 common skill points and 5 skill points to spend on social or courtly skills.

> E.g. A 49 yr old, veteran actor is a private investigator in modern day London gets 4 additional common skill points and 4 points in vocationally appropriate skills.

If the actor's age band is **Senior or Elderly**, no additional skill points are gained.

### Intense Academic Study
Up to **three 'academic' age bands** can be spent in intense study during an Actor's life, these should be dedicated periods of study. The actor receives **three points** per year, up to a maximum of fifteen points, to be spent on specialist or academic subjects for each age band. The actor **doesn't gain vocational** skill points during these periods.

> E.g. An actor in the prime of their life attends university, they will receive 5 common skill points, and 15 knowledge skill points from academic study.

## E. Spend Skill Points on Skills
Skill points should be spent on skills which are reasonably associated with the background, opportunities and the Actor's career path(s). An amount of flexibility and freedom can be allowed here, following the spirit of developing skills which would be available to the actor.

Training in skills is tracked at five levels; untrained, training, accomplished, master and expert. An actor must spent points to move from one training level to the next level.

### Points Required to Gain Training in Skills

| Level of Training | Cost | Cumulative Cost | Benefit |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---:|
| Untrained | 0 | 0 | 0 Bd |
| Trained|  +2 | 2 | 2 Bd |
|Accomplished | +3 | 5 | 3 Bd |
| Master | +4 | 9 | 4 Bd |
|Expert | +5 | 14 | 5 Bd | 

If an age band doesn't provide enough points to elevate a skill to the next level, you can record the progress towards the next skill level and complete it in the next age band.

If this you are recording a new skill, add it to the trained section and note the 1pt invested. The actor can use this skill as if trained, with an additional 1Rd penalty.

### Achieving Mastery
Once an actor is a Master or Expert in a skill, they may acquire specific bonuses which can be triggered **based on patterns of dice** in the pool results. The benefits provide additional results, bonuses or benefits without changing the rolled dice themselves (i.e. they shouldn't trigger a re-roll of the pool)

For each skill that an actor has mastery they gain an inspired bonus;
- Triple '4's count as an additional success for that skill check

For each skill that they are an expert in they gain;
- Triple '3's or '4's count as an additional success for that skill check

> E.g. a master of Law attempts to prepare a difficult case for court. The actor has a base pool of  Mental of 3Bd + mastery of law 4Bd vs a resistance pool of difficult task 4Rd + 1Rd for mental lower than skill training level. 7Bd {6,5,4,4,4,2,1} vs 5Rd {6,4,3,3,2} and a net 1 success. His mastery of the law inspired him to spot a loop hole, which he can exploit for an additional one success, which brings his successes to net two and an overall success.

### Example Skill Lists
[Link to Example Skill Lists](/docs/2_actors/skill_list.md)

## F. Adding Personality
People are complex and varied, capturing and describing their personality and motivations is done through a matrix of definitions.

- Guiding Traits
- Scars & Strengths
- Dramatic Passions
- Bonds
- Goals

### Guiding Traits
Up to three guiding traits are recorded to help define a characters personality and approach to life. The traits can contribute mechanically to situations, but are **mostly** used to guide and drive role playing, decision making and consistent action. 

[Primary trait is the single most dominant trait and can apply +3Bd dice to a pool when directly applicable. Secondary 2Bd and Tertiary 1Bd add more depth and color to a character's personality. - TODO, dial traits out of the mix?]

Example traits;

| Loyal | Self Controlled | Persistent | Spiritual |
| Impatient | Greedy | Cruel | Unforgiving |
| Ambitious | Fearless | Vengeful | Calculating |
| Desperate | Persuasive | Twisted | Faith/Principle |
| Worldly | Courageous | Cowardly | Honest & Fair |
| Deceitful/Untrustworthy | Abstaining | Indulgent | Shrewd
| Rash | Insecure/Humble | Proud/Narcissist | Envious |
| Kind/Forgiving | Callous/Vengeful | Amiable/Generous | Greedy/Selfish |
| Angry | Calm | Gossip | Jealous |

[TODO tidy up for PC traits, with example application]

### Scars & Strengths
Scars and Strengths are two sides of the same coin, moments which have left a lasting mark on a character's psyche. When a dramatic and impactful event occurs it can be seen as something which has a lasting and mechanical effect on the character.

- Scars are negatives events which haunt a person, perhaps a fear or phobia, or a memory of situation with great consequence or impact to that person.
   A **Scar** **will contribute nRd resistance penalties** to tests which would trigger the actor's scar

- Strength is the positive consequence of events or dramatic situations, the experience of which will positive impact future interactions of this nature.
  A **Strength** **will contribute  nBd base dice** in situations which benefit from the actor's strength.

### Dramatic Passions
Dramatic passions are deeply held, sometimes are overwhelming and always core to a person's actions. Gaining a dramatic passion is usually the result of an event, situation or consequence of role playing. 
A person can have **up to** THREE different dramatic passions, each is rated as a Passion (2Dd), Strong Passion (3Dd) or an Intense Passion (4Dd).
When called upon in support of an action or test, Passions are added as Drama dice (nDd) and are rolled as part of the Drama Pool.

### Dramatic Actions
[TODO]
- Spend DA to trigger an action
- Gain a dice pattern and special outcome (for combat especially)

### Bonds
Bonds represent the strong, re-assuring connections, faith and relationships that influence people's personality and choices. A bond provides a strength which can be used in support or against appropriate situations, providing positive dice. 

Bonds are forged around connections which can be relied on. Normal subjects include family, friendship, fellowship, belief or faith but could also include a reliance on a drug or object. A bond can be recognized based on anything which is important to the character, one caveat, bonds must be able to be broken or shaken.
- Family - Either a general familial bond or specific bond between family members.
- Friendship - Closeness, love or respect of friendship
- Fellowship - fraternity, society or the bonds of belonging which comes from be part of something larger than oneself
- Belief or Faith - religion, doctrine, science 
- Reliance on... - something which gives the character confidence, reprieve from fears or pressure and without which they are 'in pieces'
- Oaths or meaningful promises - something that has a strong purpose and lasting effect

When a Bond is gained or recognized, it can contribute to a person’s Composure. When a Bond is broken, it can also reduce Composure.

### Goals
[TODO]

## G. Starting Resources
- Social Status
- Connections
- Occupation
- Era specific resources

> E.g The number of Social Connections or 'followers' currency in a modern cyberpunk setting

# 6. Generate the Currency Pools
- A. Flesh
- B. Grit
- C. Fortitude
- D. Composure
- E. Drama Points

## A. Flesh Currency Pool
The starting value of 5 + a pool of 5 + 3Bd + 3Rd + 2 times Physical as Dd

> E.g. 5 + 3Bd {4,3,2} = 0 + 3Rd {5,3,2} = -1 + 4Dd {6,4,4,3,1} = 2 which equals a total of 6 Flesh

## B. Grit Currency Pool
The starting value of 5 + a pool of5 + 3Bd + 3Rd + 2 times Agility as Dd

## C. Fortitude Currency Pool
The starting value of 5 + a pool of 3Bd + 3Rd + 2 times Mental as Dd

## D. Composure Pool
The starting value of 5 + a pool of 5 + 2 times number of bonds as Bd + 3Rd + Social as Dd

> E.g. 5 + three bonds 6Bd {6,5,3,3,2,1} = 2 + 3Rd {6,3,2} = -1 + 3Dd {5,4,2} = 2 which equals a total of 8

## E. Drama Point Pool
Actor level determines the basic number of drama points for the pool. For each passion that the actor has taken, they get an additional drama point to their maximum.

> E.g. A supporting actor has a single passion, they have a total of 5 drama points, 4 from being a supporting actor and 1 for their passion.


# 7. Contacts and Possessions
Add in a few key contacts and connections that the actor has. These people can provide contacts or resources in the future.

List the main possessions that the actors has available, in keeping with the occupation, social status and situation. This may be a discussion with the Director.

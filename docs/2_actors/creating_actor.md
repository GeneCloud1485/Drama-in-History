# Creating Your Actor
> Design goals: to build characters that have rich and interesting personalities and backgrounds. The approach is to build the actor in layers, taking blocks of time that represent their past in turn and building up the attributes, skills and personality details along that journey. The character and story of the actor is revealed as the layers are added on the base. 

Step tone is to set the tone for the character's life by looking at their formative years, and then working through each age band through to the actor's current age. You can create young or old characters this way, and each will have a basic journey and backstory developed at the end of the process. There is plenty of room to embellish and add to the actor's narrative as you work through the bands.

1. Choose some key factors that made up your actor's **formative years**.
2. Establish their initial **Boon & Flaw**
3. Choose a **favored and dis-favored** attribute
4. Decide on the actor's **current age** and background
5. Work through the **actor's past** up to their current age - repeat this stage for each age band until you reach the actor's current age band.
6. Generate the **currency** pools

# 1. Formative Years
The 1st two age bands, baby & child, which take your actor through to age 10. This will deal with your family situation and early years, customized to be in keeping with the game setting, period, and Director's guidance.

- Choose a family context
	- Father & mother's position, status, standing, relative wealth and family outline.
- Choose Urban or Country life as the 1st background 
- Decide on a 'Start in Life' that is in keeping with the family background and your character concept. Were their early years;
	- Religious, Secular or Pastoral?
		- Establish if faith is important in your actor's life, create an appropriate bond
	- Rich or Poor?
		- Does this situation impact the actor's personality and thinking? Is money a goal? 
	- Is the actor's life considered loving, dramatic, hated or insignificant?  
		- Establish a childhood bond, or add a scar, or lifetime goal
	- Are they Uneducated or Educated?
		- If educated roll 10Bd each success is a skill point of common or knowledge skills. 
		- If uneducated roll 10Bd each success is a common skill point.
	- Healthy or Sickly
		- Test your luck (roll 6Bd and 6Rd)
		- If net result is a positive +1 to an attribute
		- If negative then -1 to an attribute otherwise no effect.
		- Use the level of success to add their narrative 
- Roll for and allocate the core attribute points
	- Allocate 3 + net successes from 2Dd to the core attributes

> E.g. 3 + 2Dd {4,2} = 4 net successes. Allocated 1 to Physical, none to Agility, 1 to Mental, and 2 to Social

# 2. Boons & Flaws
Each actor has inherent boons or flaws which could for formative factors in their life story. 

## Boons
Roll 2d6 for a Boon, read horizontally for the 1st die result and vertically for the 2nd.

| Boon | Physical | Agility | Mental | Social | Trait | Strength |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| ... | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |

| 6 | Phlegmatic 2Rd phy skills | Choleric 2Rd Agl skills | Melancholic 2Rd Mnt skills | Bleak humor 2Rd Soc skills | Greedy | Harboring a dark secret |

Adjust or adapt to fit an actor's story if the Director agrees.

# 3. Favored and Disfavored Attribute
Choose one of the four attributes to be favored and one which is dis-favored. 
A favored attribute is easier to raise to a higher value, and a dis-favored attribute is harder to raise to a higher value.

[[3. Core Attributes]]

# 4. Current Age & Background
Choose a current age for your actor, and mark which age bands are part of their history.

Agree with the director the background for your actor.

# 5. An Actor's Past
To develop your actor's background follow each of the following steps for **each of the age bands up to their current one**. Starting with the Juvenile age band, repeat this stage until you complete the current age band. Follow these steps;
- A. Check for the effects of Aging
- B.  Roll for the addition or loss of core attribute points
- C. Assign these points, remembering to take into account your favored and dis-favored attributes
- D. Decide on a background
- E. Calculate the skill points
- F. Spend those skill points on skill
- G. Decide if there are any major or narrative events which happened during this period. Use this to agree with the Director on their reputation, bonds generated, traits, or create scars or strengths accordingly.
- H. If appropriate increase the actor level and apply the benefits of increase an actor level.

## A. Check for the Effects of Aging 
The first step is to check for the effects of aging. The Aging currency reflects how likely the actor is to suffer from serious illness which impacts their attributes. The older the actor the more likely they are to see a reduction in attributes below zero.

Aging starts at 0 for all age bands through Prime, unless a childhood illness increased the starting Aging currency value. For the Adult and for each subsequent age band 1 is added the Aging value.

- Roll 6Bd + Aging as Rd, with the result having the following effect;

| Net Level of Success| Effect |
| :---| :---|
|1+ | no effect |
| 0 | Additional +1 to Aging | 
| -1 or less | Loss of attribute = level of success, and +1 additional Aging|

> E.g. An actor hitting the Mature age band has an Aging of 2, they roll 6Bd {5,5,3,2,2,1} and 2Rd {6,1} for a net 1 level of success, and no additional aging effects.

When an attribute loss is rolled,  use the width of the positive roll to determine which attribute;

| Width | Attribute | 
| :--- | :--- |
| 6 | Physical |
| 5 | Physical |
|4 | Physical | 
| 3 | Agility |
| 2 | Mental | 
| 1 | Social | 

Attribute loss through aging can take the attribute below zero. If an attribute reaches -3 the actor has to retire.

> E.g. An actor reaching Senior has an Aging of 6 (4 + 2 from prior effects of aging rolls), they roll 6Bd {6,6,5,3,1,1} and 7 Rd {5,4,2,2,1,1} for a net -1. This adds an additional 1 to their Aging currency, and lose 1 point of Physical. The attribute is determined by looking at the base dice result and seeing which number has the widest result i.e. the most of that number. In this case two '6's are the widest. It tied, take the highest.

A Drama Point permanently deducted from Max Drama Points can be used to offset each point of attribute loss due to aging.

## b.  Additional Attribute Points
For the age band, add the **net success results** of a dice pool to any fixed value and spend those points on increasing or reducing attributes. Any attribute can be increased for age bands through Mature, after that only Mental or Social can be improved.

The dice pool is built using the base, resistance and drama dice from the table below, based on the row for the age band being calculated.

When reducing attributes, **ignore any reduction below zero** due this step of generating an Actor's past. [TODO - knock on from adding in aging, can you choose to target an attribute at 0 to avoid a penalty? or should you have to take it if you can?]

|Age Band|Which Attributes|Fixed Value|nBd Base|nRd Aging P or A|nRd Aging M or S|nDd Drama|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Child|PAMS|3|0|||2Dd|
|Juvenile|PAMS|3|0|||2Dd|
|Youth|PAMS|2|1Bd|1Rd||1Dd|
|Prime|PAMS|1|2Bd|1Rd||0|
|Adult|PAMS|1|2Bd|2Rd||0|
|Mature|PAMS|0|2Bd|2Rd|1Rd|0|
|Veteran|MS|0|2Bd|2Rd|1Rd|0|
|Senior|MS|0|1Bd|3Rd|2Rd|0|
|Aged|MS|0|1Bd|4Rd|2Rd|0|
|Elderly|-| 0| 0|4Rd|4Rd|0|

> E.g. Juvenile = 3 + 2Dd {6,4,2} for a total of 5 pts

> or Veteran = 0 + 2Bd {4,4} + 2Rd {4,2} + 1Rd {2} for a loss of 1 pt, which should reduced either Mental or Social

## C. Assign Point to Attributes
The cost to increase an attribute by a point is determined by level of the new attribute value, and modified if favored or dis-favored

|Normal| Favored | Dis-favored|
|---|---|---|
| 1-4 = 1 pt | 1-5 = 1pt | 1-3 = 1 pt |
| 5+ = 2 pts | 6+ = 2 pts | 4+ = 2 pts |

> E.g. Raising Physical from 3 to 4 costs 1 pt unless it is the dis-favored attribute, in which case it would cost 2 pts

Attributes of 5+ are superior, and attributes of 0 or less represent a significant weakness. Any attribute which reaches -3 represents an incapacity and the actor is retired.

Reducing an attribute always costs 1 point, regardless of the level of the attribute.

> E.g Raising a favored Social from 5 to 6 would cost 2 pts but 4 would only cost 1 pt to drop it back from 6 to 5 as a result of aging.

## D. Decide on a Background for the Age Band
For each Age Band choose how your Actor spent the focus of their time during this Age Band.

### Background
A background provides a summary of the main occupation or emphasis of a period of time in the actor's past.

## E. Calculate Skill Points & Skills Available
There are three sources of skill points; from life's general lessons, from vocational opportunities or through academic study. Skills points are only gained from Juvenile to Veteran.

1. Life's lessons, **each year that passes** in an age band provides **one point** to be used on common skills.
2. Vocational opportunities, each year of an age band provides **one point** to be use on common or vocational skills
3. Optional academic study, is limited to total of three age bands and provides **ten points per age band** to be spent on academic knowledge skills.

### Developing Common Skills
Everyone can learn, practice or improve their training level in common skills, no particular background situation is required to progress.

> E.g. In a medieval setting, the 'mature' age band is 5 years long and provides 5 points to spend on common skills

### Learning Speciality Vocational Skills
The setting and era will determine how many additional skill points are available to an actor from an age band. Each year provides one point that can be spent on common or specialist vocational skills. These points can only be spent on skills which align with the actor's profession and opportunity during this age band.

> E.g. If the actor was able to gain vocational training or through simple re-enforcement of core skills, or had free time to invest in skill development then they gain additional points to spend on more expert or knowledge skills.

> E.g. A mature actor serving in King Richard II's court gains 5 common skill points and 5 skill points to spend on social or courtly skills.

> E.g. A 49 yr old, veteran actor is a private investigator in modern day London gets 4 additional common skill points and 4 points in vocationally appropriate skills.

If the actor's age band is **Senior or Elderly**, no additional skill points are gained.

### Intense Academic Study
Up to **three 'academic' age bands** can be spent in intense study during an Actor's life, these should be dedicated periods of study. The actor receives **three points** per year, up to a maximum of fifteen points, to be spent on specialist or academic subjects for each age band. The actor **doesn't gain vocational** skill points during these periods.

> E.g. An actor in the prime of their life attends university, they will receive 5 common skill points, and 15 knowledge skill points from academic study.

## F. Spend Skill Points on Skills
Skill points should be spent on skills which are reasonably associated with the background, opportunities and the Actor's career path(s). An amount of flexibility and freedom can be allowed here, following the spirit of developing skills which would be available to the actor.

Training in skills is tracked at five levels; untrained, training, accomplished, master and expert. An actor must spent points to move from one training level to the next level.

### Points Required to Gain Training in Skills

| Level of Training | Cost | Cumulative Cost | Benefit |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---:|
| Untrained | 0 | 0 | 0 Bd |
| Trained|  +2 | 2 | 2 Bd |
|Accomplished | +3 | 5 | 3 Bd |
| Master | +4 | 9 | 4 Bd |
|Expert | +5 | 14 | 5 Bd | 

If an age band doesn't provide enough points to elevate a skill to the next level, you can record the progress towards the next skill level and complete it in the next age band.

If this you are recording a **new** skill, add it to the trained section and note the 1pt invested. The actor can use this skill as if trained, with an additional 1Rd penalty.

With **existing** skills that are partially advanced to the next level of mastery, keep a record of the points invested but don't move the skill up to the next level until the full amount has been invested.

### Achieving Mastery
Once an actor is a Master or Expert in a skill, they may acquire specific bonuses which can be triggered **based on patterns of dice** in the pool results. The benefits provide additional results, bonuses or benefits without changing the rolled dice themselves (i.e. they shouldn't trigger a re-roll of the pool)

For each skill that an actor has mastery they gain an inspired bonus;
- Triple '4's count as an additional success for that skill check

For each skill that they are an expert in they gain;
- Triple '3's or '4's count as an additional success for that skill check

> E.g. a master of Law attempts to prepare a difficult case for court. The actor has a base pool of  Mental of 3Bd + mastery of law 4Bd vs a resistance pool of difficult task 4Rd + 1Rd for mental lower than skill training level. 7Bd {6,5,4,4,4,2,1} vs 5Rd {6,4,3,3,2} and a net 1 success. His mastery of the law inspired him to spot a loop hole, which he can exploit for an additional one success, which brings his successes to net two and an overall success.

### Example Skill Lists
[Link to Example Skill Lists](/docs/2_actors/skill_list.md)

## G. Adding Personality
People are complex and varied, capturing and describing their personality and motivations is done through a matrix of definitions.

- Guiding Traits
- Scars & Strengths
- Dramatic Passions
- Bonds
- Goals

### Guiding Traits
Up to three guiding traits are recorded to help define a characters personality and approach to life. The traits can on occasions contribute mechanically to situations, but are **mostly** used to guide and drive role playing, decision making and consistent action. 

Primary trait is the actor's dominant trait, and when directly appropriate can apply +2Bd dice to a pool. Secondary and Tertiary are to add more depth and color to a character's personality, without mechanical benefit.

Example traits;

| Loyal | Self Controlled | Persistent | Spiritual |
| Impatient | Greedy | Cruel | Unforgiving |
| Ambitious | Fearless | Vengeful | Calculating |
| Desperate | Persuasive | Twisted | Faith/Principle |
| Worldly | Courageous | Cowardly | Honest & Fair |
| Deceitful/Untrustworthy | Abstaining | Indulgent | Shrewd
| Rash | Insecure/Humble | Proud/Narcissist | Envious |
| Kind/Forgiving | Callous/Vengeful | Amiable/Generous | Greedy/Selfish |
| Angry | Calm | Gossip | Jealous |

### Scars & Strengths
Scars and Strengths are two sides of the same coin, moments which have left a lasting mark on a character's psyche. When a dramatic and impactful event occurs it can be seen as something which has a lasting and mechanical effect on the character.

- Scars are negatives events which haunt a person, perhaps a fear or phobia, or a memory of situation with great consequence or impact to that person.
   A **Scar** **will contribute nRd resistance penalties** to tests which would trigger the actor's scar

- Strength is the positive consequence of events or dramatic situations, the experience of which will positive impact future interactions of this nature.
  A **Strength** **will contribute  nBd base dice** in situations which benefit from the actor's strength.

### Dramatic Passions
Dramatic passions are deeply held, and sometimes overwhelming but always core to an actor's decision and actions. A dramatic passion can be established during the actor creation process, or can be taken during play.

The opportunity to gain a dramatic passion is usually the result of a situation, event or meeting, and should be the consequence of role play and player interest. The taking of a passion should be initiated by the Actor, but needs the Director's agreement.

> E.g A young woman, recently spurned in love, meets an attentive, charismatic older man at a party. The player decides that sparks fly and she is swept up in a passionate attraction to the man. The Actor and Director agree, and they take a passion for the man.

A person can have **up to** THREE different dramatic passions, each is rated as a Passion (2Dd), Strong Passion (3Dd) or an Intense Passion (4Dd). When called upon in support of an action or test, Passions are added as Drama dice (nDd) and are rolled as part of the Drama Pool. Passions can be called on a limited number of times per story.

| Passion | Drama nDd | Times per Story |
| :---| :---: | :---:|
| Passion | 2Dd | 2|
| Strong Passion | 3Dd | 3 | 
| Intense Passion | 4Dd | 4 |

[TODO] creating dice patterns which represent 'dramatic' outcomes the passion is used

### Dramatic Actions
When an actor advances in Actor Level they can gain an additional dramatic action.
Starting DA
Gaining DA in play?

[TODO]

### Bonds
Bonds represent the strong, re-assuring connections, faith and relationships that influence people's personality and choices. A bond provides a strength which can be used in support or against appropriate situations, providing positive dice. 

Bonds are forged around connections which can be relied on. Normal subjects include family, friendship, fellowship, belief or faith but could also include a reliance on a drug or object. A bond can be recognized based on anything which is important to the character, one caveat, bonds must be able to be broken or shaken.
- Family - Either a general familial bond or specific bond between family members.
- Friendship - Closeness, love or respect of friendship
- Fellowship - fraternity, society or the bonds of belonging which comes from be part of something larger than oneself
- Belief or Faith - religion, doctrine, science 
- Reliance on... - something which gives the character confidence, reprieve from fears or pressure and without which they are 'in pieces'
- Oaths or meaningful promises - something that has a strong purpose and lasting effect

When a Bond is gained or recognized, it can contribute to a person’s Composure. When a Bond is broken, it can also reduce Composure.

### Current Goals
Try to set a dominant, life defining goal and spine of the the actor's motivations. This goal should be an itch that will be very hard to scratch, and something which will influence the actors choices for good or bad. The goal should create opportunities for drama, conflict and struggle in their story.

> E.g. To find a reason for life, or see justice and peace prevail, or seeking parent's approval, prove their self-worth, to be unconditionally loved, to be the best.

Add any supporting, shorter term goals which represents an initial objective or desire for the actor. This will likely expand with play.

> E.g. Solve the case and get the recognition, get enough money to buy a race horse, survive the upcoming battle


## H. Advance the Actor Level if appropriate
[TODO]

# 6. Generate the Currency Pools
- A. Flesh
- B. Grit
- C. Fortitude
- D. Composure
- E. Drama Points
- F. Starting Resources

## A. Flesh Currency Pool
The starting value of 4 + the successes from a pool of double the Physical attribute as Bd + 2Dd

[OLD VERSION The starting value of 5 + the successes from a pool of 3Bd + 3Rd + Physical as Dd]

> E.g. 4 + two Physical 4Bd {5,3,3,2} = 1 + 2Dd {6,4,1} = 1 for a total of 2 which equals a total of 6 Flesh

## B. Grit Currency Pool
The starting value of 4 + the successes from a pool of double the Agility attribute as Bd + 2Dd

## C. Fortitude Currency Pool
The starting value of 4 + the successes from a pool of Mental + Social attributes as Bd + 2Dd

## D. Composure Pool
The starting value of 4 + the successes from a pool of the number of Bonds + Social as Bd + 2Dd

> E.g. 4 + three bonds + Social of three for 6Bd {6,6,5,3,2,1} = 3 success + 2Dd {5,2} = 2 successes which equals a total of 9 Composure

## E. Drama Point Pool
Actor level determines the basic number of drama points for the pool. For each passion that the actor has taken, they get an additional drama point to their maximum.

> E.g. A supporting actor has a single passion, they have a total of 5 drama points, 4 from being a supporting actor and 1 for their passion.

## F. Starting Resources
Agree on their current situation, occupation and location. Use this to determine their **starting resources** including their social status.

- Calculate the actor's Social Status
- List major connections
- Occupation
- Era specific resources and possessions

Calculate the actor's current Status (or social status depending on the era.

Add in a few key contacts and connections that the actor has. These people can provide contacts or resources in the future.

> E.g The number of Social Connections or 'followers' currency in a modern cyberpunk setting

List the main possessions that the actors has available, in keeping with the occupation, social status and situation. This may be a discussion with the Director.

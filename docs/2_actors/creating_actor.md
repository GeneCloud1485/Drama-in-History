# Creating Your Actor
[TODO - explanation of sequence here...]
1. Choose some key factors that made up your actor's **formative years**.
2. Establish their initial **Boon & Flaw**
3. Choose a **favored and dis-favored** attribute
4. Decide on the actor's **current age** and background
5. Work through the **actor's past** up to their current age

# 1. Formative Years
The 1st two age bands, baby & child, which take your actor through to age 10. This will deal with your family situation and early years, customized to be in keeping with the game setting, period, and Director's guidance.

1. Choose a family context - father & mother's position, status, standing, relative wealth and family outline.
2. Choose Urban or Country life as the 1st background
3. Decide on your actor's 'Start in Life' that is in keeping with the family background and your character concept. Were their early years;
	3. Worldly, Secular or Pastoral?
	4. Rich or Poor?  - determines the tone of your childhood
	5. Loving, dramatic, hated or insignificant?  - establish a childhood bond 
	6. Uneducated or Educated? - If educated roll 8Bd each success is a skill point of basic knowledge skills
	7. Healthy or Sickly - test your luck (roll 6Bd and 6Rd), if net result is a positive +1 to an attribute, if negative then -1 to an attribute otherwise no effect.
4. Roll for and allocate the core attribute points
	1. Allocate 3 + net successes from 2Dd to the core attributes

> E.g. 3 + 2Dd {4,2} = 4 net successes. Allocated 1 to Physical, none to Agility, 1 to Mental, and 2 to Social

# 2. Boons & Flaws
Each actor has inherent boons or flaws which could for formative factors in their life story. 

## Boons
Roll 2d6 for a Boon, read horizontally for the 1st die result and vertically for the 2nd.

Adjust or adapt to fit an actor's story if the Director agrees.

# 3. Favored and Disfavored Attribute
Choose one of the four attributes to be favored and one which is dis-favored. 
A favored attribute is easier to raise to a higher value, and a dis-favored attribute is harder to raise to a higher value.
[[3. Core Attributes]]

# 4. Current Age & Background

# 5. An Actor's Past
To develop your actor's background follow each of the following steps for **each of the age bands up to their current one**. Starting with the age band after 'Child' up to the current age band, follow these steps;
A.  Roll for the addition or loss of core attribute points
B. Assign these points, remembering to take into account your favored and dis-favored attributes
C. Decide on a background
D. Calculate the skill points
E. Spend those skill points on skill
F. Decide if there are any major or narrative events which happened during this period, generate bonds, traits, dramatic advantages or create scars or strengths accordingly.
G. Agree on their current situation, occupation and location. Use this to determine their **starting resources** including their social status.

## A.  Additional Attribute Points

|Age Band|Which Attributes|Fixed|Risk|Base|Aging P or A|Age M or S|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Child|PAMS|3|2Dd|0|||
|Juvenile|PAMS|3|2Dd|0|||
|Youth|PAMS|2|1Dd|1Bd|||
|Prime|PAMS|1|1Dd|1Bd|||
|Adult|PAMS|1|0|1Bd|1Rd||
|Mature|PAMS|1|0|1Bd|2Rd|1Rd|
|Veteran|MS|0|0|1Bd|2Rd|1Rd|
|Senior|MS|0|0|1Bd|3Rd|2Rd|
|Aged|MS|0|0|1Bd|4Rd|2Rd|
|Elderly| | | | |4Rd|4Rd|

## B. Assign Point to Attributes
Costs to increase an attribute by a point

|Normal| Favored | Dis-favored|
|---|---|---|
| 1-4 = 1 pt | 1-5 = 1pt | 1-3 = 1 pt |
| 5+ = 2 pts | 6+ = 2 pts | 4+ = 2 pts |

## C. Decide on a Background for the Age Band
For each Age Band choose how your Actor spent the focus of their time during this Age Band.

### Background
A background provides a summary of the main occupation or emphasis of a period of time in the actor's past.

## D. Calculate Skill Points & Skills Available
Everyone can learn, practice or improve their training level in common skills, no particular background situation is required to progress. Each age band provides **five skill points** to develop common skills.

Depending on the setting, era and available education will determine how many additional skill points are available to an actor during a period of time reflected as an age band. An **additional five skills points** are available to spend on vocational or specific or knowledge skills related to the background.

> E.g. If the actor was able to gain vocational training or through simple re-enforcement of core skills, or had free time to invest in skill development then they gain additional points to spend on more expert or knowledge skills.

If a full age band is completed, allocate the five points. If it is partially completed, then pro rata the years completed for skill point development.

> E.g. A mature actor serving in King Richard II's court gains 5 common skill points and 5 skill points to spend on social or courtly skills.

> E.g. A 58 yr old,  senior actor is a private investigator in modern day London gets 2 additional common skill points.

If the actor's age band is Elderly, no additional skill points are gained.

Up to **two 'academic' age bands** can be spent in intense study during an Actor's life, these should be full time and dedicated periods of study. An additional five skill points to be spent on academic subjects.

> E.g. An actor in the prime of their life attends university, they will receive 5 common skill points, 5 knowledge or specialist skill points and 5 knowledge skill points from academic study.

## E. Spend Skill Points on Skills
Skill points should be spent on skills which are reasonably associated with the background, opportunities and the Actor's career path(s). An amount of flexibility and freedom can be allowed here, following the spirit of developing skills which would be available to the actor.

Training in skills is tracked at five levels; untrained, training, accomplished, master and expert. An actor must spent points to move from one training level to the next level.

### Points Required to Gain Training in Skills

| Level of Training | Cost | Cumulative Cost | Benefit |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---:|
| Untrained | 0 | 0 | 0 Bd |
| Trained|  +2 | 2 | 2 Bd |
|Accomplished | +3 | 5 | 3 Bd |
| Master | +4 | 9 | 4 Bd |
|Expert | +5 | 14 | 5 Bd | 

If an age band doesn't provide enough points to elevate a skill to the next level, you can record the progress towards the next skill level and complete it in the next age band.

Once an actor is a Master or Expert in a skill, they may acquire specific benefits which can be triggered based on patterns of dice in the pool results. The benefits provide additional results, bonuses or benefits without changing the rolled dice results themselves (i.e. they shouldn't trigger a re-roll or change the core outcome of the result.)


### Example Skill Lists
[Link to Example Skill Lists](/docs/2_actors/skill_list.md)


## F. Adding Personality
People are complex and varied, capturing and describing their personality and motivations is done through a matrix of definitions.

- Guiding Traits
- Scars & Strengths
- Dramatic Passions
- Bonds


### Guiding Traits
Up to three guiding traits are recorded to help define a characters personality and approach to life. The traits can contribute mechanically to situations, but are **mostly** used to guide and drive role playing, decision making and consistent action. 

[Primary trait is the single most dominant trait and can apply +3Bd dice to a pool when directly applicable. Secondary 2Bd and Tertiary 1Bd add more depth and color to a character's personality. - TODO, dial traits out of the mix?]

Example traits;

| Loyal | Self Controlled | Persistent | Spiritual |
| Impatient | Greedy | Cruel | Unforgiving |
| Ambitious | Fearless | Vengeful | Calculating |
| Desperate | Persuasive | Twisted | Faith/Principle |
| Worldly | Courageous | Cowardly | Honest & Fair |
| Deceitful/Untrustworthy | Abstaining | Indulgent | Shrewd
| Rash | Insecure/Humble | Proud/Narcissist | Envious |
| Kind/Forgiving | Callous/Vengeful | Amiable/Generous | Greedy/Selfish |
| Angry | Calm | Gossip | Jealous |

[TODO tidy up for PC traits, with example application]

### Scars & Strengths
Scars and Strengths are two sides of the same coin, moments which have left a lasting mark on a character's psyche. When a dramatic and impactful event occurs it can be seen as something which has a lasting and mechanical effect on the character.

- Scars are negatives events which haunt a person, perhaps a fear or phobia, or a memory of situation with great consequence or impact to that person.
   A **Scar** **will contribute nRd resistance penalties** to tests which would trigger the actor's scar

- Strength is the positive consequence of events or dramatic situations, the experience of which will positive impact future interactions of this nature.
  A **Strength** **will contribute  nBd base dice** in situations which benefit from the actor's strength.

### Dramatic Passions
Dramatic passions are deeply held, sometimes are overwhelming and always core to a person's actions. Gaining a dramatic passion is usually the result of an event, situation or consequence of role playing. 
A person can have **up to** THREE different dramatic passions, each is rated as a Passion (2Dd), Strong Passion (3Dd) or an Intense Passion (4Dd).
When called upon in support of an action or test, Passions are added as Drama dice (nDd) and are rolled as part of the Drama Pool.

### Dramatic Actions
[TODO]
- Spend DA to trigger an action
- Gain a dice pattern and special outcome (for combat especially)

### Bonds
Bonds represent the strong, re-assuring connections, faith and relationships that influence people's personality and choices. A bond provides a strength which can be used in support or against appropriate situations, providing positive dice. 

Bonds are forged around connections which can be relied on. Normal subjects include family, friendship, fellowship, belief or faith but could also include a reliance on a drug or object. A bond can be recognized based on anything which is important to the character, one caveat, bonds must be able to be broken or shaken.
- Family - Either a general familial bond or specific bond between family members.
- Friendship - Closeness, love or respect of friendship
- Fellowship - fraternity, society or the bonds of belonging which comes from be part of something larger than oneself
- Belief or Faith - religion, doctrine, science 
- Reliance on... - something which gives the character confidence, reprieve from fears or pressure and without which they are 'in pieces'
- Oaths or meaningful promises - something that has a strong purpose and lasting effect

When a Bond is gained or recognized, it can contribute to a person’s Composure. When a Bond is broken, it can also reduce Composure.

## G. Starting Resources
- Social Status
- Connections
- Occupation
- Era specific resources
> E.g The number of Social Connections or 'followers' currency in a modern cyberpunk setting

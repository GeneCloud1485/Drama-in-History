All Actors are represented by a number of core attributes, currency pools and a list of skills, bonds, traits, scars & strengths and passions.

# **Four Core Attributes**
Four attributes are the basis of the characters statistical description and provide the foundation values for skill checks.

-   **Physical** (Phy)
-   **Agility** (Agl)
-   **Mental** (Mnt)
-   **Social** (Soc)

Each attribute from -3 up to 8

-   -3 represents total incapacity and retirement 
-   0 or less represent a significant weakness or disability
-   1 is a weakness
-   2 represents average
-   3-4 is above average or good talent
-   5 is superior
-   6 is uniquely talented or blessed
-   7+ is extraordinary and very rare

# Currency Pools
Currency Pools represent a more dynamic value than the primary attributes. They start 
Maximum Currency Pool values are determined [TODO LINK] and record. The current pool value is tracked separately as the pool can be reduced as a result of the outcome of situations, and recover with the passage of time. 

> A currency pool is just like tracking maximum hit points and current hit points in many other games.

### Core Pools
-   **Flesh Pool** =  physical health and core strength derived from the Physical attribute. Flesh damage represents a physical wound, recovery is a slow and potentially fraught journey.
-   **Fortitude Pool** = mental strength and sanity derived from the Mental attribute. Fortitude can be reduced by shocking or horrifying situations. Recovery is a slow process.

When Flesh or Fortitude pools are reduced to 50% or less the character gains +1 penalty dice. 
If Flesh or Fortitude pools reach ZERO the character is out of play, either dying or potentially permanently insane. [TODO LINK]

### Temporary Pools
-   **Grit Pool** = quickness and good luck derived from the Agility attribute. Grit reduction reflects fatigue or the use of luck or experience to avoid physical harm. Recovery is a relatively quick process, measured in hours.
-   **Composure Pool** = confidence, social resilience to persuasion derived from the Social attribute. Composure is reduced in challenging, tense or social situations and it can recovered fairly quickly.
[TODO could this be called Confidence rather than Composure?]

When Grit or Composure are reduced to ZERO gain +1 persistent penalty dice. Subsequent reductions to Grit or Composure are passed directly to Flesh or Fortitude.

#### Additional Temporary Pools
- **Penalty Pool** = the number of current, persistent penalty dice that an actor is dealing with. These penalties are applied to all tests, and are therefore a matter of concern for the Actor.
- **Drama Point Pool** = the maximum number and current number of Drama Points available to the Actor.

# Actor Level
Actor level reflects the relative importance or 'experience' of both player and non-player Actors. 

[TODO advancement rules]

Drama Points gained per Actor level and the likely number of total DP available to each level of actor. Additional Drama Points can also be gained when a new passion is taken, so the individual total of DP will have some variation.

| Actor Level | Points Gained | Expected Total |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Cast | 0 DP | 0 DP |
| Cameo | + 1 DP | 1 DP |
| Support | + 3 DP | 4DP |
| Actor | + 3 DP | 7 DP |
| Lead Actor | + 3 DP | 10 DP |
| Principal | + 3 DP | 13 DP |
| Title Character | + 3 DP | 16 DP |
| Starring Actor | + 3 DP | 19 DP |
| Director | + 3 DP | 22 DP |

See Drama Points for more information on the use of the currency.

# Drama Points
Drama points can be spent to take a dramatic risk, call on an advantage or to take advantage of an opportunity that presents itself (in the dice pool result). Drama points are a persistent currency pool, and spending them reduces the pool until the end of the **Season** when they recover. It is possible to recover Drama Points during play at the Director's discretion as a reward for dramatic outcomes, great RP or to keep the game flowing.
A Drama Point can be spent to add to the drama pool;
- +1Dd for a simple bonus where no appropriate advantages, skills or backgrounds to connect to the event
- +2Dd if there is an interesting 'narratively' or dramatic risk related to a specific skill or background that the actor has. 
- +3Dd + specific outcome if the Actor has a listed dramatic advantage
Or to take advantage of a situation;
- To convert one rolled base dice (Bd) '4' result into a '5' and therefore a success. This is can be chosen after the dice pool has been rolled.

# Penalty Dice
Penalty dice represent the persistent but temporary stress, pressure or disadvantages that an actor is suffering from. They can be gained as a result of a number of actions or outcomes, and can be recovered by rest without the cause of stress.

They differ from a situational modifier, which would typically be applied for one test or roll. Penalty dice are persistent and apply to all skill tests.

**Examples causes of persistent penalties;**

- Converting a 'Yes, but...' result into a success
- When Flesh or Fortitude pools get to less than 50%
- When Grit or Composure pools get to zero
- As a result of a currency test (Flesh Knock-out, Fortitude Shock or Composure pool check)

- Fatigue - results of prolonged exposure, hunger/thirst etc or an exhausted pool of Grit
- Fear or Morale - results of a failed Mortal Fear check
- Uncertainty & Stress - resulting from failed awareness in stressful situation (exploring), before battle, in unknown territory with failed Country Life, failing a social roll under scrutiny
- Discombobulated - lost of social contest
- Drunk or drugged - excess consumption

# Consider the Setting
...

[TODO each setting will adapt and tweak the backgrounds, age bands and skills]

...

# Age Bands
For simplicity actor's age is represented as a band rather than a specific age. The age bands are a way to summarize the actor's life, experiences and skills that they have developed.

While individual player Actors are a specific age in years, they are treated as being in an age band that most closely reflects their age. Once the actor reaches the lowest age in an age band they are regarded as being in that band.

> e.g. a 16 year old is recorded as a Youth or a 42 year old actor is known to be Senior.

The age ranges can change depending on the era of the game, but the names of the bands stay the same.

> e.g. someone aged 32 in a modern 20/21st Century game is known as an Adult, while they are Mature in a Medieval setting.

| |15th C|18th C|20/21st C|
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
||Medieval|Renaissance|Modern|
|Baby|(0-5)|(0-5)|(0-5)|
|Child|(5-10)|(5-10)|(5-10)|
|Juvenile|(10-15)|(10-15)|(10-15) |
|Youth|(15-20)|(15-20)|(15-20) |
|Prime|(20-25)|(20-25)|(20-25) |
|Adult|(25-30)|(25-30)|(25-35) |
|Mature|(30-35)|(30-35)|(35-45) |
|Veteran|(35-40)|(35-45)|(45-55) |
|Senior|(40-50)|(45-55)|(55-65) |
|Aged|50-60)|(55-65)|65-75) |
|Elderly|(60+)|(65+)|(75+)|

# Aging
The later age bands apply **nRd** to the rolls for changes in Primary Attributes with the possibility of reducing the Actor's core attributes with time.

See An Actor's Past.

# Social Status
Social Status is based on a character's family status at birth, their estate and their current office or role.

> _E.g. Born to a Townsman Burgess (2), working as an artisan (+1) and holding the office of Journeyman (2) for a total combined status of 5._

> _Or Born of a Common: 1/2 Virgator (1), after years of service in the Church (4) and now holding the office of Almoner at the Abbey (4) for a combined status of 9_

[TODO add example social status table]

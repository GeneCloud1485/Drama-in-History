All Actors are represented by a number of core attributes, currency pools and a list of skills, bonds, traits, scars & strengths and passions.

[Actor Character Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MlQemuFafaUU84K-_Nkapsf_nrYnwLPwuweegK_m68A/edit?usp=sharing)

# **Four Core Attributes**
Four attributes are the basis of the characters statistical description and provide the foundation values for skill checks.

-   **Physical** (Phy)
-   **Agility** (Agl)
-   **Mental** (Mnt)
-   **Social** (Soc)

Each attribute can range from -3 up to 8

-   -3 represents total incapacity and retirement 
-   0 or less represents a significant weakness or disability
-   1 is below average and a weakness
-   2 represents average
-   3-4 is above average or good talent
-   5 is superior
-   6 is uniquely talented or blessed
-   7+ is extraordinary and very rare

# Currency Pools
Currency Pools represent a more dynamic value than the primary attributes. They start at Maximum Currency Pool value and the current pool value is tracked separately as the pool can be reduced as a result of the outcome of situations, and recover with the passage of time. 

> A currency pool is just like tracking maximum hit points and current hit points in many other games.

### Core Pools
-   **Flesh Pool** =  physical health and core strength derived from the Physical attribute. Flesh damage represents a physical wound, recovery is a slow and potentially fraught journey.
-   **Fortitude Pool** = mental strength and sanity derived from the Mental attribute. Fortitude can be reduced by shocking or horrifying situations. Recovery is a slow process.

When Flesh or Fortitude pools are reduced to 50% or less the character gains +1 penalty dice. 
If Flesh or Fortitude pools reach ZERO the character is out of play, either dying or potentially permanently insane. 

### Temporary Pools
-   **Grit Pool** = quickness and good luck derived from the Agility attribute. Grit reduction reflects fatigue or the use of luck or experience to avoid physical harm. Recovery is a relatively quick process, measured in hours.
-   **Composure Pool** = confidence, social resilience to persuasion derived from the Social attribute. Composure is reduced in challenging, tense or social situations and it can recovered fairly quickly.
[TODO could this be called Confidence rather than Composure?]

When Grit or Composure are reduced to ZERO gain +1 persistent penalty dice. Subsequent reductions to Grit or Composure are passed directly to Flesh or Fortitude.

#### Additional Temporary Pools
- **Penalty Pool** = the number of current, persistent penalty dice that an actor is dealing with. These penalties are applied to all tests, and are therefore a matter of concern for the Actor.
- **Drama Point Pool** = the maximum number and current number of Drama Points available to the Actor.

# Actor Level
Actor level reflects the relative importance or 'experience' of both player and non-player Actors.  Player Actors tend to start at the Cameo level rather than Cast.

The greater the actor's reputation the higher the actor level they attain. Actor level represents a general assessment of their importance to stories that are playing out. 

### Benefits of advancing in Actor Levels
When an actor advances to a new actor level they gain +1 currency point into either their Grit or Composure max value, they gain additional Drama Points, and at some levels gain a new Dramatic Action. 

| Actor Level | Points Gained | Expected Total | Dramatic Actions |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Cast | 0 DP | 0 DP ||
| Cameo | + 1 DP | 1 DP ||
| Support | + 3 DP | 4 DP |+1|
| Actor | + 3 DP | 7 DP |+1|
| Lead Actor | + 3 DP | 10 DP |+1|
| Principal | + 3 DP | 13 DP |+1|
| Title Character | + 3 DP | 16 DP |+1|
| Starring Actor | + 3 DP | 19 DP |+1|
| Director | + 3 DP | 22 DP |+1|

Additional Drama Points can also be gained when a new dramatic passion is taken, and so an individual's total of DP will have some variation from this table.

See Drama Points for more information on the use of the currency.

# Drama Points
Drama points can be spent to call on a dramatic action or an advantage or to take advantage of an opportunity that presents itself (in the dice pool result). Drama points are a persistent currency pool, and spending them reduces the pool until the end of the **Season** when they recover. It is possible to recover Drama Points during play at the Director's discretion as a reward for dramatic outcomes, great RP or to keep the game flowing.

A Drama Point can be spent to add to the drama pool;
- +1Dd for a simple bonus where **no** appropriate advantages, skills or backgrounds to connect to the event
- +2Dd if there is an interesting drama/narrative connection, or related to a specific skill or background that the actor has. 
- +3Dd plus a specific benefit or outcome beyond the dice pool, if the Actor has a specific listed dramatic advantage

Or to take advantage of a situation;
- To convert **one** rolled base dice (Bd) '4' result into a '5' and therefore a success. This is can be chosen **after the dice pool has been rolled**. The '4' still counts as a '4' for the dice pool result pattern matching.

> E.g. an actor in a very challenging test have initially come up short with zero net successes. They mastery of the skill, and rolled triple 4's which provides +1 success, they decide to spend a drama point to upgrade one of the '4' into a '5' to gain additional +1. Converting the '4' doesn't break the triple, and they achieve a net two success and succeed.

# Penalty Dice
Penalty dice represent the persistent but temporary stress, pressure or disadvantages that an actor is suffering from. They can be gained as a result of a number of actions or outcomes, and can be recovered by rest without the cause of stress.

They differ from a situational modifier, which would typically be applied for one test or roll. Penalty dice are persistent and apply to all skill tests.

**Examples causes of persistent penalties;**

- Converting a 'Yes, but...' result into a success
- When Flesh or Fortitude pools get to less than 50%
- When Grit or Composure pools get to zero
- As a result of a currency test (Flesh Knock-out, Fortitude Shock or Composure pool check)

- Fatigue - results of prolonged exposure, hunger/thirst etc or an exhausted pool of Grit
- Fear or Morale - results of a failed Mortal Fear check
- Uncertainty & Stress - resulting from failed awareness in stressful situation (exploring), before battle, in unknown territory with failed Country Life, failing a social roll under scrutiny
- Discombobulated - lost of social contest
- Drunk or drugged - excess consumption

# Consider the Setting
...

[TODO each setting will adapt and tweak the backgrounds, age bands and skills]

...

# Age Bands
For simplicity actor's age is represented as a band rather than a specific age. The age bands are a way to summarize the actor's life, experiences and skills that they have developed.

While individual player Actors are a specific age in years, they are treated as being in an age band that most closely reflects their age. Once the actor reaches the lowest age in an age band they are regarded as being in that band.

> e.g. a 16 year old is recorded as a Youth or a 42 year old actor is known to be Senior.

The age ranges can change depending on the era of the game, but the names of the bands stay the same.

> e.g. someone aged 32 in a modern 20/21st Century game is known as an Adult, while they are Mature in a Medieval setting.

| |15th C|18th C|20/21st C|
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
||Medieval|Renaissance|Modern|
|Baby|(0-5)|(0-5)|(0-5)|
|Child|(5-10)|(5-10)|(5-10)|
|Juvenile|(10-15)|(10-15)|(10-15) |
|Youth|(15-20)|(15-20)|(15-20) |
|Prime|(20-25)|(20-25)|(20-25) |
|Adult|(25-30)|(25-30)|(25-35) |
|Mature|(30-35)|(30-35)|(35-45) |
|Veteran|(35-40)|(35-45)|(45-55) |
|Senior|(40-50)|(45-55)|(55-65) |
|Aged|50-60)|(55-65)|65-75) |
|Elderly|(60+)|(65+)|(75+)|

# Aging
Aging tends to reduce the Primary Attributes to zero, and creates the possibility of sickness reducing the Actor's core attributes below zero with the possibility of becoming infirm to the the point of retirement.

Aging is a currency which is normally 0 until an actor reaches their Prime, at which point it rises by 1 per age band by default. Aging rolls can increase and decrease the aging currency.

See An Actor's Past for the aging process.

# Status
Depending on the era, status is more or less important. In early periods 'social' status can be very impactful and important, in later periods status can reflect opportunity or a reflection of connections and respect.

Status is a reflection of birth, occupation, office or rank and reputation.

# Reputation
Total reputation reflects the sum of the actor's dramatic, notable or notorious acts recorded throughout their career. 

~Each story completed can be worth ~5-10 reputation depending on the importance of the story, the actor's performance.

> E.g. An actor receives 3 reputation for their role in the completion of a story, and an additional 2 points for playing strongly to their dramatic traits & passions.

## Gaining Reputation
Reputation reflects both notable and notorious acts and stories that are told about the actor. It is gained as a result of dramatic, important actions, completing scenes and stories.

Maximum of 1 level of rank increased per Year in the Autumn & Winter season

## Reputation Bands

Total reputation determines the rank of the Actor, and has an effect on social status. Improving the Cast Rank of the actor will also increase the number of drama points available.

| Total Reputation | Description | Min # Stories | Cast Rank | Effect | 
| :---| :---| :--- |:--- |:--- |
|0-5 | Little reputation | 1 story | Cast | None|
| 5-10 | ... | 2 stories| Cameo |  +1 pt status|
| 10-20 | | 3 stories | Support| +2 pt status|
| 20-40|| 4 stories | Actor| +4 pt status|
| 40-70 | | 6 stories | Lead Actor| +6 pt status|
| 70-120 | | 8 stories | Principal| +8 pt status|
| 120-180 | | 10 stories | Title Character| +10 pt status|
| 180+ || 12 stories | Starring Actor| +12 pt status|

The social status addition is calculated by current reputation divided by five.

> E.g. The farmer is known for his honesty, and is relied on to resolve matters of common law around the village. He has a reputation of 8, which adds +1 to his social status.

[Creating Your Actor](/docs/2_actors/creating_actor.md)

## Late Medieval Social Status
Social Status is based on a character's family status at birth, their estate and their current office or role.

> _E.g. Born to a Townsman Burgess (2), working as an artisan (+1) and holding the office of Journeyman (2) for a total combined status of 5._

> _Or Born of a Common: 1/2 Virgator (1), after years of service in the Church (4) and now holding the office of Almoner at the Abbey (4) for a combined status of 9_

Combine the Social Status for Class of Birth, Estate and Office, and then add a factor for reputation.

| Class of Birth | Social Status | 
| :--- | :---:|
| Cottar | 0 | 
|Townsman: non-burgess|	0|
|Common: 1/2 Virgater|	1|
|Common: Virgater	|2|
|Townsman: burgess|	2|
|Guildsmaster	|3|
|Petty Noble/Gentry|	5|
|Noble	|8|
|Aristocracy	|12|
|Royalty	|15|

| Estate | Social Status | 
| :--- | :---:|
|Unskilled/Worker/Servant	|0|
|Respected/Craftsman/Artisan	|1|
|Nobility/Land Owners (Gentry)|	3|
|Churchman	|4|

| Office or Position | Example | Social Status | 
| :--- | :--- | :---:|
|Absolute Royalty|"King"|20|
|Royal Title	| Queen, Prince	|15|
|Elite Office|	Arch Bishop	|12|
|Elite Title|	Duke	|12|
|High Office	|Sheriff, Bishop, Abbot, Lord Mayor	|8|
|High Title|	Earl	|8|
|Mid Title	|Marquis, Lord of larger estates	|6|
|Guild Master|	Head of the Tailor’s Guild in x town|	4|
|Office of Rank|	Justice of the Peace, Mayor, Named position at Abbey (Cellarer, Almoner etc), Alderman	|4|
|Low Title	|Lord small manorial estate|	4|
|Common Office	|Deacon, Parson, Priest, Bailiff	|3|
|Pre-Title	|Squire, Esquire	|3|
|Land owner |Manorial	Franklin	|3|
|Master with reputation	|Master tailor|	3|
|Tradesman - worthy profession|	Blacksmith, Inn keeper	|2|
|Journeyman of Guild|	Journeyman merchant trader|	2|
|Low Office	|Field Steward|	2|
|Tradesman - unworthy field|	Tanner, Carter, Brothelkeeper	|1|
|Apprentice	|Assistant to an Office Role, Lay Brother, or Guild apprentice	|1|
|Diverse other|	Servant, simple tradesman, militiaman, farmer	|1|
|None	|	|0|

> E.g. an actor born to a family who have a smallholding and farm, common: 1/2 virgator +1. The actor's estate is as a respected craftsman +2, and the actor has the low office of field steward for +2. The actor's combined social status is 4.

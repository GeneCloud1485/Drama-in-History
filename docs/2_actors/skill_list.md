A lot of skills are shared across different historical settings, but some skills and knowledge are era specific. These lists are intended as a guideline and there is no restriction on expanding the lists.

Where a skill is listed as X or Y, the attribute will be chosen based on the context of use.

> E.g. Hunting can be based on Mental when placing snares or based on Agility when attempting to shoot a prey.

Where a skill is listed as X ^ Y it means that the first attribute is capped by the second.

> E.g. Attempting to lie is a Social skill, but the Social attribute is capped by the Mental attribute. A person with a Social of 4 with a Mental of 2, will contribute 2 to the skill rather than 4 of their social. Being silver tongued is only so useful, if you can't stay true to your story or forget details!

## Backgrounds
Backgrounds can be a combination of a 'domain' and 'vocation'. They can indicate social status, class and a specific profession. This combination should provide enough indication on general domain knowledge, plus a narrow definition of vocational skills.

> E.g. Scholarly Life: Lawyer or Manorial Life: Steward

| Background | Domain Description | Possible Vocations | 
| :--- |  :--- |  :--- | 
| Courtly Life | ||
|Village Life ||
|Manorial Life ||
|Military Life ||
|Servants Life ||
|Guild Company Life ||

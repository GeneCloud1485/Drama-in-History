All Actors are represented by a number of core attributes, currency pools and a list of skills, bonds, traits, scars & strengths and passions.

# **Four Core Attributes**
Four attributes are the basis of the characters statistical description and provide the foundation values for skill checks.

-   **Physical**
-   **Agility**
-   **Mental**
-   **Social**

Each attribute from -3 up to 8

-   -3 represents incapacity
-   0 or less represent a weakness
-   1-2 represents average
-   3-4 is good
-   5 is greatly superior
-   6+ is extraordinary

# Currency Pools
Currency Pools represent a more dynamic value than the primary attributes. They start 
Maximum Currency Pool values are determined [TODO LINK] and record. The current pool value is tracked separately as the pool can be reduced as a result of the outcome of situations, and recover with the passage of time. 

> A currency pool is just like tracking maximum hit points and current hit points in many other games.

### Core Pools
-   **Flesh Pool** =  physical health and core strength derived from the Physical attribute. Flesh damage represents a physical wound, recovery is a slow and potentially fraught journey.
-   **Fortitude Pool** = mental strength and sanity derived from the Mental attribute. Fortitude can be reduced by shocking or horrifying situations. Recovery is a slow process.

When Flesh or Fortitude pools are reduced to 50% or less the character gains +1 penalty die. 
If Flesh or Fortitude pools reach ZERO the character is out of play, either dying or potentially permanently insane. [TODO LINK]

### Temporary Pools
-   **Grit Pool** = quickness and good luck derived from the Agility attribute. Grit reduction reflects fatigue or the use of luck or experience to avoid physical harm. Recovery is a relatively quick process, measured in hours.
-   **Composure Pool** = confidence, social resilience to persuasion derived from the Social attribute. Composure is reduced in challenging, tense or social situations and it can recovered fairly quickly.
[TODO could this be called Confidence rather than Composure?]

When Grit or Composure are reduced to ZERO gain +1 penalty die. Subsequent reductions to Grit or Composure are passed directly to Flesh or Fortitude.

##### Additional Temporary Pools
- **Penalty Pool** = the number of current, persistent penalty dice that an actor is dealing with. These penalties are applied to all tests, and are therefore a matter of concern for the Actor.
- **Drama Point Pool** = the maximum number and current number of Drama Points available to the Actor.

# Actor Level
For both players and NPC progression.

[TODO advancement rules]

Drama Points gained per Actor level

| Actor Level | Points Gained | Expected Total |

Additional Drama Points can also be gained when a new passion is taken. 

# Consider the Setting
...

# Age Ranges
For simplicity actor's age is represented as a band rather than a specific age.

While individual player Actors are a specific age in years, they are treated as being in an age band that most closely reflects their age. Once the actor reaches the lowest age in an age band they are regarded as being in that band.

> e.g. a 16 year old is recorded as being a Youth or a 32 year old actor is known to be Mature.

The age ranges can change depending on the era of the game, but the names of the bands stay the same.

> e.g. someone aged 32 in a modern 20/21st Century game is known as an Adult compared while they are Mature in a Medieval setting.

# Defining Your Actor
1. Choose some key factors that made up your actor's formative years.
2. Establish their initial Boon & Flaw
3. Choose a favored and dis-favored attribute
4. Choose a target age and background
5. Work through the age bands
	1. Rolling for PAMS attribute points
	2. Assigning the points
	3. Calculating skill points
	4. Spending skill points on advancing skills

# Formative Years
The 1st age band... family setup in keeping with the game setting, period, and Director's guidance.

1. Choose a family context - father & mother's position, status, standing, relative wealth and family outline.
2. Choose Urban or Country life as the 1st background
3. Decide on your actor's 'Start in Life' that is in keeping with the family background and your character concept. Were their early years;
	3. Worldly, Secular or Pastoral?
	4. Rich or Poor?  - determines the tone of your childhood
	5. Loving, dramatic, hated or insignificant?  - establish a childhood bond 
	6. Uneducated or Educated? - If educated roll 8Bd each success is a skill point of basic knowledge skills
	7. Healthy or Sickly - test your luck (roll 6Bd and 6Rd), if net result is a positive +1 to an attribute, if negative then -1 to an attribute otherwise no effect.

# Boons & Flaws
Each actor has inherent boons or flaws which could for formative factors in their life story. 

## Boons
Roll 2d6 for a Boon, read horizontally for the 1st die result and vertically for the 2nd.

Adjust or adapt to fit an actor's story if the Director agrees.

# Favored and Disfavored Attribute
Choose one of the four attributes to be favored and one which is dis-favored. 
A favored attribute is easier to raise to a higher value, and a dis-favored attribute is harder to raise to a higher value.
[[3. Core Attributes]]

# Working through an Actor's past by Age Band
For each age band after 'Child' up to the current age band, follow these steps;
1. Roll for the addition or loss of core attribute points
2. Assign these points, remembering to take into account your favored and dis-favored attributes
3. Decide on a background
4. Calculate the skill points
5. Spend those skill points on skill
6. Decide if there are any major or narrative events which happened during this period, generate bonds, traits, dramatic advantages or create scars or strengths accordingly.

## 1.  Additional Attribute Points

## 2. Assign Point to Attributes

## 3. Decide on a Background


# Background
A background provides a summary of the main occupation or emphasis of a period of time in the actor's past.

If no specific named skill available, backgrounds can be used in reflection of general experience.

- Yes directly = 1 background for +1Bd, 2 for +2Bd, max of 3 for +3Bd
- Kinda or indirectly = 1 background for +1Bd & 1Rd, max of 2 for 2Bd & 1Rd [TODO - should this be 2Rd]

## 4. Calculate Skill Points
If a full age band is completed
If partially completed

## 5. Spend Skill Points on Skills
People are complex and varied, capturing and describing their personality and motivations is done through a matrix of definitions.
### Training in Skill
- Untrained 0Bd
- Trained +2Bd
- Accomplished +3Bd
- Master +4Bd
- Expert +5Bd

## 6. Adding Personality
- Guiding Traits
- Scars & Strengths
- Dramatic Passions
- Bonds




# Guiding Traits
Up to three guiding traits are recorded to help define a characters personality and approach to life. The traits can contribute mechanically to situations, but are **mostly** used to guide and drive role playing, decision making and consistent action. 

[Primary trait is the single most dominant trait and can apply +3Bd dice to a pool when directly applicable. Secondary 2Bd and Tertiary 1Bd add more depth and color to a character's personality. - TODO, dial traits out of the mix?]

Example traits;

| Loyal | Self Controlled | Persistent | Spiritual |
| Impatient | Greedy | Cruel | Unforgiving |
| Ambitious | Fearless | Vengeful | Calculating |
| Desperate | Persuasive | Twisted | Faith/Principle |
| Worldly | Courageous | Cowardly | Honest & Fair |
| Deceitful/Untrustworthy | Abstaining | Indulgent | Shrewd
| Rash | Insecure/Humble | Proud/Narcissist | Envious |
| Kind/Forgiving | Callous/Vengeful | Amiable/Generous | Greedy/Selfish |
| Angry | Calm | Gossip | Jealous |

[TODO tidy up for PC traits, with example application]

# Scars & Strengths
Scars and Strengths are two sides of the same coin, moments which have left a lasting mark on a character's psyche. When a dramatic and impactful event occurs it can be seen as something which has a lasting and mechanical effect on the character.

- Scars are negatives events which haunt a person, perhaps a fear or phobia, or a memory of situation with great consequence or impact to that person.
   A **Scar** **will contribute nRd resistance penalties** to tests which would trigger the actor's scar

- Strength is the positive consequence of events or dramatic situations, the experience of which will positive impact future interactions of this nature.
  A **Strength** **will contribute  nBd base dice** in situations which benefit from the actor's strength.

# Dramatic Passions
Dramatic passions are deeply held, sometimes are overwhelming and always core to a person's actions. Gaining a dramatic passion is usually the result of an event, situation or consequence of role playing. 
A person can have **up to** THREE different dramatic passions, each is rated as a Passion (2Dd), Strong Passion (3Dd) or an Intense Passion (4Dd).
When called upon in support of an action or test, Passions are added as Drama dice (nDd) and are rolled as part of the Drama Pool.

# Bonds
Bonds represent the strong, re-assuring connections, faith and relationships that influence people's personality and choices. A bond provides a strength which can be used in support or against appropriate situations, providing positive dice. 

Bonds are forged around connections which can be relied on. Normal subjects include family, friendship, fellowship, belief or faith but could also include a reliance on a drug or object. A bond can be recognized based on anything which is important to the character, one caveat, bonds must be able to be broken or shaken.
- Family - Either a general familial bond or specific bond between family members.
- Friendship - Closeness, love or respect of friendship
- Fellowship - fraternity, society or the bonds of belonging which comes from be part of something larger than oneself
- Belief or Faith - religion, doctrine, science 
- Reliance on... - something which gives the character confidence, reprieve from fears or pressure and without which they are 'in pieces'
- Oaths or meaningful promises - something that has a strong purpose and lasting effect

When a Bond is gained or recognized, it can contribute to a person’s Composure. When a Bond is broken, it can also reduce Composure.

# Social Status
Social Status is based on a character's family status at birth, their estate and their current office or role.

> _E.g. Born to a Townsman Burgess (2), working as an artisan (+1) and holding the office of Journeyman (2) for a total combined status of 5._

> _Or Born of a Common: 1/2 Virgator (1), after years of service in the Church (4) and now holding the office of Almoner at the Abbey (4) for a combined status of 9_


# Aging
Old age bands can apply nRd to Primary Attributes reducing the Actor's PAMS. 

See Working Through Age Bands

# Drama Points
Drama points can be spent to take a dramatic risk, call on an advantage or to take advantage of an opportunity that presents itself (in the dice pool result). Drama points are a persistent currency pool, and spending them reduces the pool until the end of the **Season** when they recover. It is possible to recover Drama Points during play at the Director's discretion as a reward for dramatic outcomes, great RP or to keep the game flowing.
A Drama Point can be spent to add to the drama pool;
- +1Dd for a simple bonus where no appropriate advantages, skills or backgrounds to connect to the event
- +2Dd if there is an interesting 'narratively' or dramatic risk related to a specific skill or background that the actor has. 
- +3Dd + specific outcome if the Actor has a listed dramatic advantage
Or to take advantage of a situation;
- To convert one rolled base dice (Bd) '4' result into a '5' and therefore a success. This is can be chosen after the dice pool has been rolled.



# Penalty Dice
Penalty dice represent the persistent but temporary stress, pressure or disadvantages that an actor is suffering from. They can be gained as a result of a number of actions or outcomes, and can be recovered by rest without the cause of stress.

They differ from a situational modifier, which would typically be applied for one test or roll. Penalty dice are persistent and apply to all skill tests.

**Examples causes of persistent penalties;**

- Converting a 'Yes, but...' result into a success
- When Flesh or Fortitude pools get to less than 50%
- When Grit or Composure pools get to zero
- As a result of a currency test (Flesh Knock-out, Fortitude Shock or Composure pool check)

- Fatigue - results of prolonged exposure, hunger/thirst etc or an exhausted pool of Grit
- Fear or Morale - results of a failed Mortal Fear check
- Uncertainty & Stress - resulting from failed awareness in stressful situation (exploring), before battle, in unknown territory with failed Country Life, failing a social roll under scrutiny
- Discombobulated - lost of social contest
- Drunk or drugged - excess consumption
-

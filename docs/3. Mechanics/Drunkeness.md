# **Drunkenness** 

After a period of indulgence and drinking to excess a state of drunkenness modifies personality traits, attribute pools and skill checks. The effects are broken into two tiers; Drunk and Very/Blind Drunk. Drunk is the 'normal' state of drunkenness after a period of indulgent drinking. Blind Drunk is only achieved after 'extreme' drinking and consumption.

**While drunk the following are all applied until the drunkenness passes;**

When drunk a character's courage and belief in themselves is exaggerated, at a cost of thinking straight and agility.

-   And all Fortitude, Composure and Courage checks

-   Plus 2P for everything else;
-   Knowledge based on Mental
-   All Agility based skills

Penalty dice are applied to all healing or recovery checks and will modify recovery times for Grit and from Penalties (the 2P need to be recovered with the normal Penalty recovery timeline)

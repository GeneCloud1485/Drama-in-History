# **Opposed Skill Tests**

Opposed test have all of the same core elements as unopposed, rather than focusing on a target number of successes, the goal is to get more successes than the opposition. The degree of success is determined by the net difference between the two outcomes, and as with unopposed rolls, the scale of the difference  indicates how successful the outcome is.

One form of opposed test might be a hunter and prey. While they may use different skills, be effected by different situational modifiers they still build a dice pool and compare the results.

The two most complex forms of opposed test are Social Contests and Combat, and they have additional rules to be considered.

## **Opposed Social Contests**

_Design Goals: To encourage role-playing in line with the characters and story for mechanical advantages in resolving a complex opposed contest. Imaginative, narrative and dramatic role-play on the part of the players should contribute 50% of the dice pool. In most cases, the NPCs should present brief narrative and character defense, but use their composure pool rather than the GM counter arguing for dice._

A social contest brings together narrative & role-play with skills & context into a complex opposed dice pool test. The scene should be setup by establishing the contest goal, then freeform role-play which brings the major advantages into play. After the role-play reaches an appropriate and dramatic point the pools are calculated and rolled to see the result. Each contest should be resolved in one test, although it is possible to keep the contest going if it is satisfactorily resolves, but the skill checks & advantages & narrative needs to be different in the second round.

## **Tests of Fortitude** 

A test of fortitude is made whenever the character is faced with a disturbing, shocking, horrific or scary situation. These can be the results of phobias, encounters with death, disease or horrors of the battle field, or engaging in mortal sins

**Loss of Fortitude**

Loss of Fortitude reflects a weakening of the mind and a grasp on reality. If a character's Fortitude is reduced to 0 they are taken temporarily mad and unable to act meaningfully. 

TODO Lasting scars - is there a need to have a partial madness from loss in one story?


**Uncontrolled Shock Effects**

Highest # of Results | Effect

6| Attempt to fight the source of the fear

5| Shout, rant and scream - incoherent, quoting biblical texts, speaking in tongues

4| Attempt to flee the scene, turn away and keep back to threat and be obsessed with leaving the scene

3| Emotional & passionate response - cry, wail, impassioned railing against the situation

2| Gag, vomit and freeze. Feel shortage of breath and hyper-tension.

1| Rock catatonic, immobile, unresponsive and vulnerable


## **Test of Composure**

A test of composure is made when the character needs to keep their cool, deal with social status pressure, contain their anger or passion, deal with feelings of uncertainty, strange atmospheres, fear

These are unopposed single tests and are different than a social contest, the outcome of a composure check confirms the persons confidence in dealing with a situation and can apply penalties if failed. 

[TODO] - how to simplify composure into skill checks like this?
A composure check can be made before a subsequent test, but should aim to ask & resolve a different question and not just be a 'double' dice test.

_E.g. Checking composure before making a Lie skill check is not necessary, the lie skill check would be enough._

**Social failure effects**

Result | Effect

6| No additional effects

5| Exaggerated discomfort = double 'degree of failure' in composure loss

4| Emotional reaction, visible to all. Reduce an existing or gain a negative bond or passion

3| Sadness which lasts the 'degree of failure' in days

2| Dizziness & Nausea, additional +1 P

1| A stress induced Scar +1

As well as any mechanical outcome the results should provide guidance on how to behave and informs role-playing.

## Joining the Melee
How your actor joins melee is sometimes a choice and sometimes a reaction to a situation or circumstance.

In the short moment before a melee is joined each aware participant has a beat to prepare themselves.

They can choose to; 
1. Prepare a dramatic action
2. Call upon deeply held passion
3. And then declare their opening stance in Actor rank order

Joining the melee normally only happens in the opening rounds of an engagement. If combatants move around during combat the option can be selected again. An engaged opponent is considered as Standing.

## Declare Stance
Each round the combatants can choose their stance, which represents how aggressively or defensively they are fighting. The person with **momentum declares their stance second**, to provide them with a small tactical advantage.

Choose from the following stances;
1. Press Attack
2. Stand
3. Brace for the Fight
4. Desperate Defend or Evade
5. Dramatic Advantage Stance

Participants who are unaware or surprised don't get a chance to prepare, and their stance is decided by circumstance - likely Stand.

#### 1. Press Attack
- Add 2 to Momentum when joining a fight, no effect in subsequent rounds
- Plus **1Dd**
- If the round is won, then + 1 to knock-back attempts
- If the round is lost, then Agility & Physical is considered one point lower for the knock-back check

#### 2. Stand 
- No benefits/penalties

#### 3. Brace for the Fight
- Minus 2 from Momentum when joining a fight, no effect in subsequent rounds
- Plus **1Ad** (armor) and **2Rd**
- If the round is lost, then Physical & Agility are considered one point higher for a knock-back test
- If the round is won, then -2 from knock-back attempts

#### 4. Desperate Defend or Evade
- Minus 6 from Momentum when joining a fight, no effect in subsequent rounds
- Plus **3Ad** (armor)
- For Defend add weapon damage or shield value as **+nAd** (armor dice)
- For Evade use **double Agility** rather than Agility & Skill
- If the evader/defender wins the round, no blow lands in either direction
- [TODO should this setup a chance to flee?] 
- [TODO benefit in next round?]

#### 5. Dramatic Stance (situational)
> Benefits determined by the specific situation and/or dramatic advantage. These can expand the standard stances

[TODO courage and bravery in the face on an enemy]

## 1st Round Establishing Momentum
Momentum tracks the ebb and flow of the upper hand in a conflict. Whoever has momentum will win ties in opposed rolls.

For the 1st round of melee the momentum is determined by the highest **Current Grit** pool value + modifier from their stance.
- Ties resolved by the highest Agility value
- Ties resolved in favor of the highest Actor level
- Ties go to the player Actors

> E.g. Two angry farmers resort to blows over a field boundary dispute. The first has a max grit of 7 and the second 6. Both choose the Stand stance, which doesn't modify momentum calculations. The first will have momentum in the first round of the conflict.
 
> or if the farmers both had max grit of 7, the tie would be resolved by their Agility attributes.

> If the second farmer chooses to be more aggressive and Press the Attack, they would receive a +3 to their momentum score which means they would receive momentum. Farmer 1 with 7 and Farmer 2 with 9.

This step is skipped in subsequent rounds as Momentum is **passed to the winner** of the round, unless a specific action or risk is taken to 'grab' momentum. 

## **Opposed Melee Rolls**
Each participants builds a dice pool, with whoever **has momentum going second**. This provides the person with momentum a small advantage of reading their opponent and responding to the allocation of military training dice or dramatic advantages.

Build a dice pool from Base, Resistance, and Drama dice;
1. **Base pool** = attribute + skill (capped by the attribute) + situational modifiers + military training (optional)
2. **Resistance pool** = persistent penalties + situational modifiers + disadvantage + stance modifier
3. **Drama pool** = risks, dramatic advantages or passions if applicable + stance modifier

Pools are then rolled and the results calculated. Remember that critical hits will increase the number of successes.

The winner is the person with the highest number of successes, the number of successes must be TWO or more to be a successful 'hit'.  Tied results are resolved by whoever has momentum at this point.

### 1. Base Pool
#### Attribute + Skill
Add the appropriate Attribute and Skill together to form the core of the Base Pool. An actor's skill is capped by their attribute.

> E.g. Swinging a mace is based on the Physical attribute added to the Knightly weapon skill. A Knight with a Physical of 4 and mastery (+4) of his weapons would start his Base Dice Pool at 8.

> If the knight trained to be an Expert in the weapons (+5), his skill would be capped at +4 by his Physical attribute, and his base pool would be 8.

#### Situational Modifiers 

| Beneficial | Modifier |
| :--- | :---: |
| From Defensive space | 2Bd |
| Height Advantage | 2Bd |

#### **Military Training Dice**
The benefit of backgrounds which count as military training is to provide an additional pool of dice which an be used as **nBd** base dice or **nAd** armour dice. Each background provides 1 die to a pool.

>E.g. a squire with 2 backgrounds in Military Life will have 2 dice in their military training pool.

### 2. Resistance Pool
#### Persistent Penalties
Add in the actor's current persistent penalty pool.

> E.g. a man-at-arms is carrying 2 penalty dice. One as a result of a wound he sustained earlier in they day, and another for failing a Test of Composure before the battle. The 2 penalty dice are added into the resistance pool to reflect his distraction and weakened state.

#### Situational Modifier
Add in any Resistance dice to reflect the difficult of the current situation.

| Situation | Modifier |
| :--- | :---: |
| Poor footing | 2Rd |  
| Bad weather | 2/4Rd | 
| Dusk | 2Rd | 
| Darkness | 4Rd | 
| Into Narrow space | 2Rd |
| Height disadvantage | 2Rd |

#### Stance Modifiers
Add in the **1Rd** when an actor has adopted a press their attack stance.

### 3. Drama Pool
#### Declaring Dramatic Actions or Passions
[TODO]
- Declaring passions - no Drama Point cost
- Declaring dramatic actions - spending Drama Points

#### Stand Modifiers
Add in the **1Dd** when an actor has adopted a press their attack stance.


## Outcome of an Opposed Melee Round
- **Winner**: One party achieves two or more net successes and greater than the other person. The difference between the opposed net successes equals the level of success.
	- **Marginal Win**: One party achieves exactly one net success, which is greater than the other party. This is a marginal win and inflicts limited amount of damage. Ignore the level of success, and apply a max of 1pt of Flesh damage, which can be blocked by Armor.
	- **Loser with Critical Success**: If the loser's roll included a critical success, and still had less successes than the winner, they will inflict a limited amount of damage on the winner. [Optional]
- **Draw**: Both parties the same number of two or more net successes, leading to a draw. A draw is resolved by who currently has momentum.
	- **Marginal Draw**: Both parties have exactly one net success. The draw is resolved by who currently has momentum. [Optional, otherwise it would be a failure]
- **Failure**: Neither party gains two net successes. 

#### Level of Success
The net difference between the two rolls creates the level of success, the greater the different the greater the success. Ties have zero levels of success.
> _E.g. 6 successes vs 3 successes creates 3 levels of success_

If one party has negative result, that is factored into the level of success difference.
> E.g. -1 success vs 3 successes creates 4 level of success

The level of success determines the amount of additional damage that is inflicted on the loser.

#### Dramatic Outcome Patterns (passive bonuses)
Additional outcomes are possible by matching dice patterns in the base pool results. Based on the actor's **weapons or dramatic advantages**
- Not modifying the result of the main dice pool result
- If win then...
- If lose then...
- If draw then...

Shields and defensive weapons use patterns to boost their nAd rolls or additional outcomes [see shields]

## Results of a Melee Round
### Wounds: Calculating Damage
There are two types of damage inflicted by the winner;
- The level of success is applied to the loser's Grit pool
- Weapon damage is applied to Flesh pool

#### Applying Damage
##### Receiving Grit Damage
The winner's level of success is the amount of Grit damage that is applied to the loser. When a Grit pool is reduced to zero, further damage is done to the Flesh pool.
-   If the target has remaining Grit, the level of success is deducted from their current Grit
-   If the target's Grit pool reaches zero, the remainder of the damage is added to Flesh damage, up to a maximum of 3 points of Flesh.
-   If the target has zero Grit remaining, the balance is transferred to Flesh damage up to a maximum of 3 Flesh.

> _E.g. 3 levels of success are applied to the target's current Grit reducing it from 4 to 1_

>_Or 5 levels of success take the loser's Grit pool from 2 to 0, and the balance of 3 generates an additional 3F flesh damage 

Note: When a Grit pool is reduced to zero, the actor adds a persistent penalty.
See Recovery of Grit

##### Determine Armor Protection
The loser rolls their Armor protection pool, counting each success as a stoppage of one point of Flesh damage.
- **Armor Pool** = Agility + Armor/Defensive harness + Shield + Stance + Situation/cover + Dramatic Advantages

>E.g. The loser, with Agl: 2 and armed with a buckler (3Ad) rolls 5Ad {5,3,3,2,1} for 1 point of flesh damage stoppage.

##### Taking a  Flesh Wound
Calculate the size of the wound, deduct any Armor stoppage and then reduce the Flesh pool by the remainder. Record the wound and deal with Knock-down and Courage test if appropriate.
- Flesh damage is based on the power and size of the weapon
- Plus any Grit damage that has been transferred to Flesh (see Grit Damage above)
- Plus any additional damage from any dramatic advantage [TODO]
- Reduced by the number of successful Armor stoppage success
- The result reflects the size of the wound and the loser's current Flesh is reduced by the total
	- If the wound causes 2+ points of Flesh damage it also adds 1 persistent penalty die
	- A 3+ Flesh damage wound requires a courage test of the Flesh Pool to avoid passing out
	- Bleeding wounds [optional]

> _E.g. An attacker wielding an axe, achieves two levels of success which is deducted from the losers Grit pool. The axe has 3F Flesh damage rating, and would do 3 flesh damage, causing a significant wound requiring a courage test and adding a persistent penalty dice.

> If the loser had armor which achieved 2 successes, then all but 1 point would be blocked by the Armor. A 1 point wound does not trigger a courage test or risk continued bleeding or cause a persistent penalty.

It is important to track each wound which delivers flesh damage, to help identify the source of penalty dice, bleeding and to manage recovery.

> _E.g. Two wounds taken during a fight, would be tracked separately. A 2 point wound and a 1 point wound. 

#### **Test of Courage**
When receiving flesh damage of two or greater points, it is necessary to call upon ones courage to avoid passing out or being incapacitated by the pain. 

See Test of the Flesh Pool

- The pool can be modified by traits, bonds, passions or situational modifiers
- These modifiers could be nBd or nRd or nDd depending on the source and the context.

>E.g. In a skirmish to secure a bridge critical to the Yorkist vanguard's progress, a squire takes a 3pt flesh wound. This triggers a test of courage to continue in the fight.

> The squire has max Flesh pool of 7, a family trait of 'brave' 2Bd, and has a 2Dd passion for the Yorkist cause. He has persistent penalty dice from this wound.

> The Test of the Flesh Pool would be 
> Base: 7+2Bd {6,6,5,5,4,3,2,2,1} for 4 successes
> Resistance: 3+1Rd {4,3,2,2} for -2 successes
> Drama: 2Dd {6,1,1} for -1 success and a total of 1 net success. 
> This is a Yes... but outcome, the squire is wavering, but decides to take the extra 1 penalty dice to convert this to a success. Shouting in pain, he grits his teeth and prepare to fight on (with two persistent penalty dice from the pain).

Successfully passing the courage test allows the actor to continue acting without further disadvantage.

Failing the test takes the actor out of the action and the scene. They pass-out or become incapacitated by the pain in some manner. They are out of the scene for (8-Physical) rounds, when they start to recover. The round that they recover they are doubly disadvantaged.

#### **Surviving Damage**
As already outlined;
- When the Grit pool = 0, add 1 additional die to the persistent penalty pool.
- Flesh wounds of 2+ contribute persistent penalties
- Flesh wounds of 3+ require Courage tests to avoid passing out

Additionally;
- Any **critical hit** which causes a Flesh wound or a flesh wound which is **50%+ of max Flesh** (round down) is classed as a **Critical Wound**.
- Critical wounds are bleeding and require medical attention
- Being reduced to 1 current flesh also requires a Courage test to avoid passing out, regardless of the size of the damage inflicted.
- When Flesh reaches 0 or below the target is automatically knocked out and falls prone
- When Flesh is negative the person is dying.

##### Limited Amount of Damage
With a marginal win or when a loser achieves a critical, a limited amount of damage is delivered.
- One point of Grit 
- And one point of Flesh, which can be stopped by an armor roll
- No knock-down check is made

### **Check For Knock-Back**
A secondary consequence of melee, the loser must check to see if they are knocked back or prone.

- **Knock-down** = Level of Success + Winner's Physical Attribute
	- If the Knock-down is greater than **either** the loser's Physical or Agility attribute then loser is **disadvantaged** e.g. knocked to knees, stunned, disorientated
	- If the Knock-down is greater than **the sum** of the loser's Physical and Agility attributes then they are **Doubly Disadvantaged** e.g. knocked down, ending the round off of their feet and dropped onto the floor.

> _E.g. An attacker with Phy:3 strikes his target with 1 level of success achieving 4 knock-down. The defender who has Phy:3 Agl:4 is disadvantaged and knocked to his knees as the winner's knock-down is greater than one of the two attributes.

> _Or if the level of success had been 3, the knock-down would have been 6 which is greater than either but less than the sum of the loser's Phy and Agl and so the loser is disadvantaged.

> If the level of success has been 5, the knock-down would have been 8 which is greater than the sum of the loser's two attributes and the loser would be doubly disadvantaged.

- **Disadvantage** is a situational  modifier applied to actions in the following round. The modifier is calculated as (4-Agility)Rd. (if Agility is higher than 4 the result is zero)
>  E.g. Loser with Agl:2 would carry a 2Rd modifier for next round.
- **Doubly Disadvantaged** is calculated as (8-Agility)Rd
> E.g. The loser with an Agl:1 will carry 7Rd into the next round.


### Determining Momentum
The winner of the rounds gains momentum for the next round of a melee.

## Return to Declare Stance and repeat

## **Fighting Multiple Opponents**
When fighting multiple opponents the an actor can choose to engage each of the opponents, or leave an opponent unopposed.

- The **Base Pool is evenly split** (or as close as possible to even) between the opponents
- If military experience points are applied to the Base Pool they can be applied to any opponents as the actor sees fit.
- An unopposed opponent get +**2Bd**
- Resistance pool is applied to each split
	- Penalties, situational and stance modifiers apply to each attack
- The Drama pool is allocated specifically to one opponent only, unless a unique Dramatic Advantage indicates differently

Each split pool is resolved separately and the results applied simultaneously.

> E.g. An accomplished and armored warrior (actor) with Physical of 3, and two points of military training is attacked by two unarmored members of the fyrd (cameo). The warrior has a base pool of 6Bd, which will split equally against each opponent. He decides to apply his military training to enhance his attack on one opponent, meaning his pool is split into two pools of 3Bd and 5Bd.

> The Fyrd have Physical 2 and are trained in their weapons with base dice pools of 4Bd each.

> The warrior also chooses to press his attack and the two fyrd choose to stand in the face of the experience warrior.

> The warrior has the higher Grit Pool score, and wins momentum for the opening round. He receives a **1Dd** bonus from pressing his attack which he assigns to his 1st opponent, who also has the higher of his split pools.

> The fight is happening on clear ground, and neither party has any persistent penalties to consider.

> Fight 1: Warrior has 5Bd {6,3,2,1,1}+ 1Dd {5} vs his opponent with 4Bd {4,3,3,1} and Warrior wins with net Two levels of success, inflicting 2 Grit and 2 points of Flesh wound. The Fyrd opponent picks up a penalty for the 2F wound, and the knock-back check (2 levels of success + 3 Physical = vs 2 Physical + 3 Agility ) indicates that the fyrd #1 is knocked back and disadvantaged.

> Fight 2: Warrior has 3Bd {4,2,1} vs 4Bd {6,2,1,1} has the fyrd #2 with a marginal win. The warrior takes 1 point of Grit, and then rolls his armor of 6Ad {5,4,4,3,2,2} which blocks 1 points of flesh damage, meaning he takes a 1 points flesh wound. The knock-back check (1 level of success + 2 physical = 3) compares to the warrior's lowest Physical or Agility modified by 1 due to his stance (meaning his attributes count at one point lower). His Physical of 3 counts as 2, and so he is off balance and disadvantaged into the next round.

> Alternatively, the warrior could have focused all of his attack on the 1st opponent, trusting in his armor to protect him from the second's attack.

> Warrior gets 8Bd {6,5,5,4,3,2,2,1}+ 1Dd {6,2} vs Fyrd #1 4Bd {4,3,1,1} = 4 levels of success. 4 Grit damage (3 as Grit and 1 passed to Flesh) plus 2+1 Flesh. The 3pt wound demands a courage test which the fyrd #1 fails, slumping to the ground.
> 
> Fyrd #2 gets an unopposed attack on the warrior with 6Bd {5,5,3,2,1,1} and two levels of success. The warrior takes 2 points of Grit, and rolls his armor pool of 6Ad {6,6,2,2,2,1} which blocks both points of Flesh damage from the attack. The knock-back check indicates that the warrior is disadvantaged (2+3 vs warriors reduced Physical) in next round.

> The second round, the warrior once again chooses to press his attack, although he is disadvantaged (4 - his 4 Agility) it doesn't impede him. The fyrd decides to Defend. The warrior has still 8Bd {6,6,6,6,3,3,1,1}+ 1Dd {1} vs the fyrd's 4Bd {5,3,3,1}, the warrior gets a critical success with four 6's, which means he counts the 6's twice, the 1 result on a Drama dice is a -1 success for a net 7 vs 1 for the opponent to leave a level of success of 6.

> The level of success is applied to Grit, passing the maximum of 3 through to Flesh along with the 2F from the weapon. The fyrd fought defensively so gets 3Ad + 2Ad for his weapon {6,3,2,2,1} blocking one point of Flesh damage. He takes a 4 point critical wound, requiring a test of courage which requires a roll of the Max Flesh Pool 7Bd {6,6,4,3,2,2,1} and 4Rd {5,3,3,1} for the wound he has just taken, the results being a net of 1 success, he collapses to the ground with his wound bleeding copiously.

## **Weapons**
The use of weapons doesn't add dice to the opposed roll, but **opens up advantages and risk/reward opportunities**. The rating of each weapon is the Flesh damage that the weapon will do before adding any Grit damage from levels of success.

| Weapon Class | Examples | Flesh Damage | 
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Unarmed or Improvised | Fist, Tankard, Hilt of Dagger | 0F | 
| Small | Dagger, Club | 1F | 
| Medium | Short Sword, Hunting Bow | 2F |
| Large | Spear, Axe, Sword, Long Bow or Crossbow | 3F |
| Extra Large | Poleax, Lance | 4F |

## **Defensive Harness & Armour**

Each item of defensive harness contributes dice to the armour pool. The armour pool is rolled and each success will block a point of potential Flesh damage.Â 

Note - any 1s or 6s rolled do not contribute to a critical success or failure

A wound inflicted is the net results of the damage - successful defense results.

> _E.g A sword doing full damage of 3F against a well armoured combatant who rolls 8D dice getting 2 blocking successes, the net damage is 1 point of Flesh._

> _Or that same combat where the defender has no Grit remaining, taking 2 successes contributing an additional 1F, leading to a 2F wound total._

**Reference Armour Tables;**

| Armour | Defense Value |

Shields add a dice pattern match opportunity in the **base** **nBd pool** which can trigger additional actions or armor dice.
- Any Triple adds 3Ad
- Any Quad adds Shield Bash delivering 1/2/3 Grit damage to the opponent, regardless of if the actor wins the round.

# **Ranged Attacks**
Ranged combat is resolved with a form of Unopposed Skill Test.

Build a dice pool from Base, Resistance, and Drama dice.
1. **Base pool** = Attribute + Skill or background (capped by the attribute)
2. **Resistance pool** = persistent penalties + difficulty of the challenge + situational modifiers
3. **Drama pool** = risks, dramatic advantages or passions applicable

### **Situational modifiers for Ranged Attacks**

|Situation | 0 | 2 Rd | 4 Rd | 6 Rd | 8 RdÂ |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Range| PB |Close| Mid | Long| Far|
|Visibility| Clear | Mist/Glare | Rain/Dusk | Fog/Near Dark| Dark|
|Wind| None| Light|Modest | Strong| Storm|
|Target Move| Stationary| Walk/Moving| Dash| Run | Gallop|
|Size of Target||Small Target|Head|Bull's Eye|

|Situation | +2 Bd |
| :--- | :--- | 
| Size bonus | vs Large target |
| Preparation |Braced|
| | Aiming for a turn|

### **Results of Ranged Combat**
The results of a ranged attack are resolved just like melee;
- Net two plus successes = Win, calculate the level of success as net successes minus two, plus the weapon damage.
- Net one success = Marginal Win, apply a max of 1pt of Flesh damage with no level of success.
- Zero or less success = Miss

> E.g. An accomplished archer with Agl 3, aiming before shooting at a deer walking in light woodland has a skill + attribute of 6Bd + 2Bd for aiming {6,5,5,4,4,2,1,1} + 4Rd for the woods and moving target {4,3,1,1} achieving a net 1 success and a marginal win. The shot wings the deer, inflicting 1F wound... which sends it racing into the trees and out of sight.

**Optional Location of Wounds**

Based on the largest numbers of results of the dice in the positive dice pool, other than 6s. Use of hit location is optional for regular hits, it adds color and drama but not mechanical benefit.

|Number | Location|
| :--- | :--- |
| 5 | Head |
| 4 | Upper torso/Chest |
|3 | Arms |
| 2 | Lower torso/Gut |
| 1 | Legs |

_E.g the attacker achieves 3 successes from 5 base dice and 2 risk advantage dice. Results; 6, 5, 3, 3, 1 and 5, 3 = there are 3 three results so that determines the location. The blow lands on the defender's lower torso_

_[TBD] courage and trait tests are all Risk dice?_

**Ongoing Bleeding Wounds**

Any wound of 2+ points of Flesh damage will bleed and continue to bleed unless treated. The bleeding value is equal to the wound value + any critical hit modifiers. Bleeding happens on a ~5 minute cycle, additional damage being endured if bleeding is not staunched.

[TBD = minutes & momentsâ¦ combat is a moment, bleeding is in minutes]

> 5 minutes / Flesh damage is the bleeding out cycle

**Staunching Wounds**

Each bleeding wound can be staunched by achieving equal or more successes than the wound level using First Aid. This is a cumulative process until wound's bleed value is met, otherwise the wound still counts as bleeding. Only one wound can be treated per 5 minutes by one person.

_E.g. a 3 point wound requires 3 levels of First Aid successes to staunch it._Â 

When the cumulative success of First Aid has met the bleed value, the wound is staunched and in normal circumstance won't cause further damage.

**Continued Bleeding**

Each ~5 minutes a bleeding wounds requires the wounded to take a test of their (max) Flesh pool to avoid further bleeding.Â 

-   The TNS is the current bleed value for the wound.Â 
-   Meeting or exceeding the TNS means no further damage is taken from the wound.Â 
-   Falling short of the TNS adds an additional point of Flesh damage to that wound. This can undo existing healing, or increase the wound level making recovery time longer.
-   A critical success will reduce the bleed value by 1

_E.g. A man-at-arms F7 is hit by a crossbow bolt for 5 points of Flesh damage which is enough to be classified as a major wound, as well as knock him to the ground._

_The blow forces a TNS2 courage test which is failed, and the combined force of the blow and pain knocks the man to the ground unconscious._

_The wound is bleeding badly, but a friend sees him fall and rushes to staunch the wound. Applying a linen compress to the wound (+2R advantage dice), the friend rolls First Aid and gets 2 successes against the cumulative target of 5. This starts to slow the bleeding but doesn't stop it completely. This process takes ~5 minutes._

_After 5 minutes of help the wounded man tests his Flesh pool to avoid suffering further damage. He fails to get any additional successes and loses another point of Flesh raising the bleed value back up to 4_

_The friend continues to staunch the wound, attempting First Aid again, getting 2 more successes to further slow the bleeding to bleed value 2._

_The wounded man must make another Flesh pool test to avoid more bleed damage. He rolls 2 success which is enough to avoid taking more damage, which allows his friend to finish staunching the wound._

_If the friend had not rushed to aid the wounded man, he would have needed to pass 5 TNS1 P checks to stop the bleeding. Any failures would have added to his already low Flesh level. For example, if he had failed 3 checks before achieving 5 success he would have lost 3 most Flesh and be down to -1. This wound would leave a long term persistent problem and added 4 more weeks recovery time._

Any significant physical action runs the risk of opening the wound and starting the bleeding process again.

**Unconscious & Dying**

Flesh levels;
* At 0 = unconscious
* At -1 = major persistent injury, +4 weeks recovery time
* At -2 = dying with little chance of recovery, need major and successful medical attention + 8 weeks recovery
* At -3 = **death**

_E.g. Having taken a couple of solid hits and having passed level 1 courage tests, the loser is then hit once more reducing their Flesh to 0. They fall unconscious to the ground, bleeding from their wounds. They must pass an additional level 1 Physical check after 5 minutes to see if the bleeding stops._

**Recovering & Healing**

_Design Goal: Create opportunities to apply wider range of skills, encourage empathy & care, and generate colorful dramatic outcomes which can persist. At a risk of additional complexity_

Even small wounds represent a risk of infection or sickness leading to lasting damage and consequences. Any bleeding wound has a chance of infection and requires time to heal and recovery. After the immediate risk of bleeding has been staunched the healing process will start after the risk of fever and infection has been overcome.

After the immediate risk of death and bleeding from a wound is completed, and in a recovery 'scene' test to see how long the infection & fever will last. Each day the fever lasts creates a need for care, the application of medical skills and a risk of consequences.

Each wound that caused Flesh damage is tracked separately. The size of the wound determines the difficulty in healing, the risk of infection and the recovery time. For simplicity focus on the largest wound received and only bleeding wounds are at risk of infection.

**Fever & Infection**

The initial recovery time and duration of the fever is a test of Flesh vs TNS of the largest Flesh wound taken, modified by the situation and the care applied. The test is made after ~12 hours or/plus the following morning.

-   TNS is set by the largest wound + 2
-   Flesh pool + situational benefits
-   Care & treatment applied during the ~12 hours
-   With penalties for situational conditions
-   Environment (how far from the best conditions is the situation?)
-   Levels of success of the roll indicates the duration of the fever period;
-   Equal or greater than TNS = fever breaks, no further rolls required
-   1 less = fever for another day
-   2 less = fever for another 3 days & check for infection/sickness on odd
-   3 or more less than the TNS = fever for another 1 week & immediate sickness result (this will cover a critical failure)

_E.g. Our man-at-arms having taken a 5pt wound from a crossbow bolt. His wound has been staunched and he is recovering after the skirmish at a nearby church._

_After the adrenaline of the battle is over, fever starts to take hold. The man-at-arms' friend is still with him and has been able to ensure that he is comfortable, and persuades the local priest to help out._

_The Priest cares for the man throughout the night, and then rolls his leechcraft 4 + 2R for a mixture of honey & feverfrew he has prepared + 2R for his strong religious faith (Religion 6). The resulting 3 successes contribute to the healing of the man-at-arms. Unfortunately for the Priest he picked up a penalty die from over praying..._

_The man-at-arms has a base pool of 7 from his Flesh 7, rolling 2 successes_

_The church is clean, dry and out of the elements. He is being cared for and only picks up 2 penalty dice for having been moved today. He rolls 0 penalties._

_The total result is 5 successes vs the 7 TNS, -2 level of success which indicates his fever will last at least for another 3 days and he risks further infection or sickness during that time._

After a period of fever another check is required to see if the fever has subsided. The TNS is lowered by 1 for each subsequent test of fever. Situational modifiers apply if they have been applied for the majority of the period of fever.

_E.g. After 3 days the man-at-arms must test again to see if the fever subsides. The TNS is 4 one lower than his initial check. The Priest and his friend have been caring for him throughout the time, and can provide assistance._

_The Priest decides to bleed the man-at-arms to reduce the 'hot moist' humors of the fever, and rolls 2 successes. The man-at-arms rolls and also gets 2 successes._

_The result matches the TNS and the man's fever breaks and he will start his full recovery the following day._Â 

**Sickness & Infection**

_Design goal: to create lasting color and memories of encounters, not to create a death spiral or punishment._

When a test of calls for a sickness check, review the results of the Flesh pool. Reading the pool, width determines the result 1-6, and even/odd of number of successes to determine the A/B outcome. The consequence adds +1 to the trait or MF.

| Reading | Symptom | Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 6 | Visions | religious or greedy & selfish traits|
| 5 | Melancholic | cold & dry, black bile - humble or indulgent traits | 
| 4 | Choleric | hot & dry, yellow bile - courageous or cruel traits |
| 3 | Phlegmatic | cold & moist, phlegm - shrewd or cowardly traits| 
| 2 | Sanguine | hot & moist, blood - generous or rash traits |
| 1 | Terrors | Mortal Fear - death or disease traits |

As well as the impact on the trait, the period of recovery is extended by +1 month.

Recovery from a wound is calculated in terms of weeks of recovery. Each point of damage is reduced by 1 point after taking the current damage in weeks of rest.

-   E.g. a 3 point wound takes 3 weeks to be reduced to a 2 point wound. The would will require another 2 weeks to reduce it to a 1 point wound.
-   4 points wounds will take 10 weeks to fully heal
-   3 points wounds take 6 weeks
-   2 point wounds take 3 weeks
-   1 point takes 1 week

Critical wound recovery is extended by 4 weeks recovery time

[[TBD]] With an infection Grit always have 1 Pen, and Grit canât be more than 50%



**Critical Wounds**

When achieving a critical hit in combat, read the positive combat dice pool of the **loser** to determine the additional impact of the hit.

Whichever number has the most results other than the 6s is the critical effect, and the lowest number of results rolled indicates the location.

_E.g. The winner of the combat has rolled 8 dice + 2R dice with the following results;Â  6, 6, 5, 5, 3, 2, 1, 1 + 6, 2, 2 >> achieving 6 successes with 3 sixes indicating a critical effect. The largest number of a number after the sizes are twos, and the least number rolled is three. **Two** is the resulting critical wound effect, and **Three** indicates the location._

_In this examples is aÂ  complication to a lower body wound_


| Number | Highest # =Effect |
|:--- | :--- |
|6 | Minor scarring
|5 | Minor break, additional 1P until recovered
|4 | Complication, requires an infection check at +2Â 
|3 | Major cut or piercing + 1 bleeding, leading to distinct scaring
|2 | Deep cut leading to additional bleeding +2 bleed and distinct scar
|1 | Major break, with longer recovery & narrative limitations - depending on location

-   First Aid - stopping bleeding & 50% value for more specific healing
-   Leechcraft - treating humours, sewing wounds, blood letting and treating sickness
-   Surgery - sewing wounds, broken bones and amputations
-   Herbalism - sickness, illness, infectionÂ 
-   Medicine - understanding sickness beyond the obvious symptoms, knowing how the body works and theoretical treatments.

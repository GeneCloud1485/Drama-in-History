## General Melee
1. Joining the melee
2. Establish Momentum

	1. Skills
	2. Dramatic Advantages
	3. Bonus patterns?
4. Applying Results


### Joining the Melee
How your actor joins melee is sometimes a choice and sometimes a reaction to a situation or circumstance.

In the short beat before a melee is joined each aware participant has a beat to prepare themselves.

They can choose to 
	1. Prepare a dramatic action
	2. Call upon deeply held passion

And then declare their stance
	1. Press
	2. Stand
	3. Defend

Participants who are unaware or surprised don't get a chance to prepare, and their stance is decided by circumstance - likely Stand.

#### 1. Press Attack
> + 3 Momentum, + 1Dd, + 1Rd, + 1 to knock-back

#### 2. Stand
> No benefits

#### 3. Defend
> +3 Ad (armor), -1 Momentum, +1 brace vs knock-back

#### 4. Dramatic Stance (situational)
> benefits determined by the specific situation and/or dramatic advantage

[TODO courage and bravery in the face on an enemy]

### Establishing Momentum
Momentum tracks the ebb and flow of the upper hand in a conflict. Whoever has momentum will win ties in opposed rolls.

For the 1st round of melee the momentum is determined by  
- The highest ==Current== Grit pool value + modifier from stance
	- Ties resolved by the highest Agility value
	- Ties resolved in favor of the highest Actor level
	- Ties go to the player Actors

Momentum is passed to the winner in a round of opposed rolls, unless a specific action or risk is taken to 'grab' momentum.

[TODO] The loser declares their pool decisions first = use of Military Life, split of pools and/or use of Advantages. This provides the winner the chance to adjust their strategy based on the slower person's choices.

## **Opposed Dice Pool Rolls**

Build a dice pool from Base, Resistance, and Drama dice.
1. **Base pool** = attribute + skill, or background
2. **Resistance pool** = persistent penalties + situational modifiers + stance modifier
3. **Drama pool** = risks, dramatic advantages or passions applicable + stance modifier

Pools are then rolled and the results calculated. The winner is the person with the highest number of successes, the number of successes must be TWO or more to be a successful 'hit'. 

- **Winner**: One party achieves two or more net successes and greater than the other person. The difference between the opposed net successes equals the level of success.
- **Draw**: Both parties the same number of two or more net successes, leading to a draw. A draw is resolved by who has momentum.
- **Failure**: Neither party gains two net successes. 

### Outcome of an Opposed Melee Round
Level of Success
The net difference between the two rolls creates the level of success, the greater the different the greater the success. Ties have 0 levels of success.

_E.g. 6 successes vs 3 successes creates 3 levels of success_

If one party has negative, that is factored into the net total as it contributes to the net difference.

The level of success determines additional damage that is inflicted on the loser


[TODO]**Dramatic Advantages in Combat**


Example **Situational Modifiers**
[TODO]
-   Context: terrain, height, visibility, weather conditions, footing, prone/knocked down
-   Tactical: choices: flanking, surprise etc

[TODO]**Military Life Training**

[TODO]Some or all of the Military Life dice can be added in addition to a base skill. Any remaining Military Life dice can be applied as defensive harness/armor dice. 

[TODO]The dice can be applied as base or as risk dice in attack or defensive dice 

[TODO]_E.g. a squire with 2 backgrounds in Military Life will have 4 dice in their military training pool. These dice can be allocated to Base, Risk/Advantages or in Defense._




**Weapons**

The use of weapons doesn't add dice to the opposed roll, but open up advantages and risk/reward opportunities. The rating of each weapon is the Flesh damage that the weapon will do before adding any Grit damage from levels of success.

Weapon Class

Examples

Flesh Damage

Unarmed or Improvised

Fist, Tankard, Hilt of Dagger

0F

Small

Dagger

1F

Medium

Short Sword, Hunting Bow

2F

Large

Spear, Axe, Sword

Long Bow or Crossbow

3F

Extra Large

Poleax, Lance

4F

**Defensive Harness & Armour**

Each item of defensive harness contributes dice to the armour pool. The armour pool is rolled and each success will block a point of potential Flesh damage. 

Note - any 1s or 6s rolled do not contribute to a critical success or failure

The wound inflicted is the net results of the damage - successful defense results.

_E.g A sword doing full damage of 3F against a well armoured combatant who rolls 8D dice getting 2 blocking successes, the net damage is 1 point of Flesh._

_Or that same combat where the defender has no Grit remaining, taking 2 successes contributing an additional 1F, leading to a 2F wound total._

**Examples;**

Armour | Defense Value

Cloak/Clothing | 1D

Heavy Cloak | 2D

Leather Cloak | 3D

Leather Jack | 2D-3D

Brigandine | 4D

Leather Hood | 1D

Metal Helm | 2D

  

**Man-at-Arms** | 9D

Arming Jack | 2D

Breastplate | 4D

Metal Helm | 2D

...Gauntlets | 1D

  

**Full Plate Armour** | 18D

Arming Jack | 2D

Breastplate | 4D

Full Helm | 3D

...Arms | 3D

...Legs | 3D

...Feet | 1D

...Gauntlets | 1D

...Neck |1D

  

**Shields**|

Buckler| 2D

Medium shield | 4D

Large shield | 5D

Special case - Some or all of Military Life Training dice can be added in addition to any physical harness dice.

**Applying Damage**

If the total number of success of the victor is even the blow is a full contact hit, if the result is odd then it is a glancing blow or close shave.

-   **Even results** apply level of success difference to Grit of the defender and then the weapon damage to the defender's Flesh. 
-   An **Odd result** applies both the level of success and weapon damage to Grit. (There are some exceptions; any un-absorbed Grit damage will roll over into Flesh, and Critical damage will go to Flesh)

**Applying Grit Damage First**

-   If the target has remaining Grit, the level of success is deducted from their current Grit
-   If the target runs out of Grit, the balance of damage is transferred to Flesh damage at 50% (round up)
-   If the target has no Grit remaining, all damage is transferred to Flesh damage at 50% (round up)

_E.g. 3 levels of success are applied to the target's current Grit reducing it from 4 to 1_

_Or 5 levels of success take remaining Grit from 2 to 0, and balance of 3 generate 2F damage_ 

**Taking Flesh Damage Second**

-   Flesh damage is based on the power and size of the weapon
-   Additionally any Grit damage that has been transferred to Flesh is counted
-   Any additional damage from a critical success or advantage [TODO]
-   This is then reduced by the number of successful defensive rolls
-   Each blow which causes Flesh damage also adds 1 penalty die (per blow not per point of damage) [TODO - maybe too negative] -> 2+ point wound
-   The loser's current Flesh is reduced by the combined totals

_E.g. Assuming no additional Grit damage is transferred into Flesh, and the attacker is using an axe (3 damage) with 1 point blocked by the defensive harness. Causing a net of 2 points of damage, and reducing current Flesh from 7 to 5._

-   Track the scale of each hit which delivers flesh damage

_E.g. Taking two wounds during a fight, each separate wounds damage is tracked. A 2 point wound and a 1 point wound. This is used for recovery and healing._

**Check For Knock-down**

-   If the net number of successes is greater than P stat but less than P+A the defender is knocked to their knees
-   If the level of success is greater than P+A then the defender is knocked to the floor

_E.g. An attacker beating a defender who has P2 A2 by 1 level of success will push the defender back but not materially impact their position_

_Or if the level of success was 3, the defender is knocked to their knees_

_Or if 5 levels of success then the defender is knocked to the floor_

**Surviving Damage**

-   When Grit = 0, add 1 additional die to the persistent penalty pool.
-   Any Flesh wound of 2 or more requires a Courageous trait test at level 1 to avoid collapsing in pain

_E.g. Having 'Courageous 5', after taking 2 points of Flesh from an axe hit the target much achieve 1 success from their 5 dice pool to stay in the fight._

-   Any critical hit Flesh wound or a wound which does 50% of max Flesh, requires an immediate test of TNS2 Courage check 2, requiring 2 successes to stay in the fight.
-   Critical wounds require medical attention and add 2 persistent penalty die to the pool. 
-   Being reduced to 1 current flesh also requires a Courage test TNS 2 to avoid passing out
-   When Flesh reaches 0 or below the target is automatically knocked out and falls prone

**Optional Location of Wounds**

Based on the largest numbers of results of the dice in the positive dice pool, other than 6s. Use of hit location is optional for regular hits, it adds color and drama but not mechanical benefit.

Number | Location

5 | Head

4 | Upper torso/Chest

3 | Arms

2 | Lower torso/Gut

1 | Legs

_E.g the attacker achieves 3 successes from 5 base dice and 2 risk advantage dice. Results; 6, 5, 3, 3, 1 and 5, 3 = there are 3 three results so that determines the location. The blow lands on the defender's lower torso_

-   6 | Head
-   5 | Upper torso/Shoulders
-   4 | Torso/Chest
-   3 | Arms
-   2 | Lower torso/Gut
-   1 | Legs

**Courage Tests**

When receiving flesh damage it can be necessary to call upon ones courage to avoid passing out or being incapacitated by the pain. The level of the test is set by the amount of damage and situation.

-   Courage dice pool can be modified by other traits, passions or situational modifiers
-   The modifier could be positive or negative

_E.g. In a skirmish to secure a bridge critical to the Yorkist vanguard's progress, a squire takes a 2pt flesh wound. This triggers a TNS 1 test of courage to continue in the fight._ 

_In addition to the squire's courage of 4 (base pool), their passion for the Yorkist cause of 1 can be added to the pool. And their pride of 5 also adds 1 dice (traits contribute +1 at 5 and +2 at 6), as they don't want to let their family down._ 

_This creates a pool of 6 seeking 1 success._

_Or in the same situation, if the squire had a secret loyalty to the Lancastrian cause, they might collect a -1._

_Or if they were drunk they could use the (penalty) dice from drunk as a positive modifier to their courage test_

  

_[TBD] courage and trait tests are all Risk dice?_

**Ongoing Bleeding Wounds**

Any wound of 2+ points of Flesh damage will bleed and continue to bleed unless treated. The bleeding value is equal to the wound value + any critical hit modifiers. Bleeding happens on a ~5 minute cycle, additional damage being endured if bleeding is not staunched.

[TBD = minutes & moments… combat is a moment, bleeding is in minutes]

>> 5 minutes / Flesh damage is the bleeding out cycle

**Staunching Wounds**

Each bleeding wound can be staunched by achieving equal or more successes than the wound level using First Aid. This is a cumulative process until wound's bleed value is met, otherwise the wound still counts as bleeding. Only one wound can be treated per 5 minutes by one person.

_E.g. a 3 point wound requires 3 levels of First Aid successes to staunch it._ 

When the cumulative success of First Aid has met the bleed value, the wound is staunched and in normal circumstance won't cause further damage.

**Continued Bleeding**

Each ~5 minutes a bleeding wounds requires the wounded to take a test of their (max) Flesh pool to avoid further bleeding. 

-   The TNS is the current bleed value for the wound. 
-   Meeting or exceeding the TNS means no further damage is taken from the wound. 
-   Falling short of the TNS adds an additional point of Flesh damage to that wound. This can undo existing healing, or increase the wound level making recovery time longer.
-   A critical success will reduce the bleed value by 1

_E.g. A man-at-arms F7 is hit by a crossbow bolt for 5 points of Flesh damage which is enough to be classified as a major wound, as well as knock him to the ground._

_The blow forces a TNS2 courage test which is failed, and the combined force of the blow and pain knocks the man to the ground unconscious._

_The wound is bleeding badly, but a friend sees him fall and rushes to staunch the wound. Applying a linen compress to the wound (+2R advantage dice), the friend rolls First Aid and gets 2 successes against the cumulative target of 5. This starts to slow the bleeding but doesn't stop it completely. This process takes ~5 minutes._

_After 5 minutes of help the wounded man tests his Flesh pool to avoid suffering further damage. He fails to get any additional successes and loses another point of Flesh raising the bleed value back up to 4_

_The friend continues to staunch the wound, attempting First Aid again, getting 2 more successes to further slow the bleeding to bleed value 2._

_The wounded man must make another Flesh pool test to avoid more bleed damage. He rolls 2 success which is enough to avoid taking more damage, which allows his friend to finish staunching the wound._

_If the friend had not rushed to aid the wounded man, he would have needed to pass 5 TNS1 P checks to stop the bleeding. Any failures would have added to his already low Flesh level. For example, if he had failed 3 checks before achieving 5 success he would have lost 3 most Flesh and be down to -1. This wound would leave a long term persistent problem and added 4 more weeks recovery time._

Any significant physical action runs the risk of opening the wound and starting the bleeding process again.

**Unconscious & Dying**

Flesh levels;

* At 0 = unconscious

* At -1 = major persistent injury, +4 weeks recovery time

* At -2 = dying with little chance of recovery, need major and successful medical attention + 8 weeks recovery

* At -3 = **death**

_E.g. Having taken a couple of solid hits and having passed level 1 courage tests, the loser is then hit once more reducing their Flesh to 0. They fall unconscious to the ground, bleeding from their wounds. They must pass an additional level 1 Physical check after 5 minutes to see if the bleeding stops._

**Recovering & Healing**

_Design Goal: Create opportunities to apply wider range of skills, encourage empathy & care, and generate colorful dramatic outcomes which can persist. At a risk of additional complexity_

Even small wounds represent a risk of infection or sickness leading to lasting damage and consequences. Any bleeding wound has a chance of infection and requires time to heal and recovery. After the immediate risk of bleeding has been staunched the healing process will start after the risk of fever and infection has been overcome.

After the immediate risk of death and bleeding from a wound is completed, and in a recovery 'scene' test to see how long the infection & fever will last. Each day the fever lasts creates a need for care, the application of medical skills and a risk of consequences.

Each wound that caused Flesh damage is tracked separately. The size of the wound determines the difficulty in healing, the risk of infection and the recovery time. For simplicity focus on the largest wound received and only bleeding wounds are at risk of infection.

**Fever & Infection**

The initial recovery time and duration of the fever is a test of Flesh vs TNS of the largest Flesh wound taken, modified by the situation and the care applied. The test is made after ~12 hours or/plus the following morning.

-   TNS is set by the largest wound + 2
-   Flesh pool + situational benefits

-   Care & treatment applied during the ~12 hours

-   With penalties for situational conditions

-   Environment (how far from the best conditions is the situation?)

-   Levels of success of the roll indicates the duration of the fever period;

-   Equal or greater than TNS = fever breaks, no further rolls required
-   1 less = fever for another day
-   2 less = fever for another 3 days & check for infection/sickness on odd
-   3 or more less than the TNS = fever for another 1 week & immediate sickness result (this will cover a critical failure)

_E.g. Our man-at-arms having taken a 5pt wound from a crossbow bolt. His wound has been staunched and he is recovering after the skirmish at a nearby church._

_After the adrenaline of the battle is over, fever starts to take hold. The man-at-arms' friend is still with him and has been able to ensure that he is comfortable, and persuades the local priest to help out._

_The Priest cares for the man throughout the night, and then rolls his leechcraft 4 + 2R for a mixture of honey & feverfrew he has prepared + 2R for his strong religious faith (Religion 6). The resulting 3 successes contribute to the healing of the man-at-arms. Unfortunately for the Priest he picked up a penalty die from over praying..._

_The man-at-arms has a base pool of 7 from his Flesh 7, rolling 2 successes_

_The church is clean, dry and out of the elements. He is being cared for and only picks up 2 penalty dice for having been moved today. He rolls 0 penalties._

_The total result is 5 successes vs the 7 TNS, -2 level of success which indicates his fever will last at least for another 3 days and he risks further infection or sickness during that time._

After a period of fever another check is required to see if the fever has subsided. The TNS is lowered by 1 for each subsequent test of fever. Situational modifiers apply if they have been applied for the majority of the period of fever.

_E.g. After 3 days the man-at-arms must test again to see if the fever subsides. The TNS is 4 one lower than his initial check. The Priest and his friend have been caring for him throughout the time, and can provide assistance._

_The Priest decides to bleed the man-at-arms to reduce the 'hot moist' humors of the fever, and rolls 2 successes. The man-at-arms rolls and also gets 2 successes._

_The result matches the TNS and the man's fever breaks and he will start his full recovery the following day._ 

**Sickness & Infection**

_Design goal: to create lasting color and memories of encounters, not to create a death spiral or punishment._

When a test of calls for a sickness check, review the results of the Flesh pool. Reading the pool, width determines the result 1-6, and even/odd of number of successes to determine the A/B outcome. The consequence adds +1 to the trait or MF.

  

Reading | Symptom | Outcome

6 | Visions | religious or greedy & selfish traits

5 | Melancholic | cold & dry, black bile - humble or indulgent traits

4 | Choleric | hot & dry, yellow bile - courageous or cruel traits

3 | Phlegmatic | cold & moist, phlegm - shrewd or cowardly traits

2 | Sanguine | hot & moist, blood - generous or rash traits

1 | Terrors | Mortal Fear - death or disease traits

As well as the impact on the trait, the period of recovery is extended by +1 month.

Recovery from a wound is calculated in terms of weeks of recovery. Each point of damage is reduced by 1 point after taking the current damage in weeks of rest.

-   E.g. a 3 point wound takes 3 weeks to be reduced to a 2 point wound. The would will require another 2 weeks to reduce it to a 1 point wound.
-   4 points wounds will take 10 weeks to fully heal
-   3 points wounds take 6 weeks
-   2 point wounds take 3 weeks
-   1 point takes 1 week

Critical wound recovery is extended by 4 weeks recovery time

[[TBD]] With an infection Grit always have 1 Pen, and Grit can’t be more than 50%

**Recovering Grit**

Lost grit is recovered with a short period of resting (~an hour). Grit is recovered with an hour of rest. The recovery takes current Grit to 'max Grit - current penalty dice’ this does not include the Agility specific penalty dice for having 0 Grit.. If no penalty dice then grit is fully restored in an hour, if rest is interrupted then grit is recovered pro-rata.

When aging penalty dice exist, each final point of Grit takes 1 day to recover.

_E.g. After a skirmish a wounded man-at-arms sits to recover his lost Grit. He has lost all of his Grit and has been lucky to only incur the 1 penalty dice for the loss of Grit and avoided anything more than a light 1pt Flesh wound. He recovers his Grit up to 9 (max 10 - 1 penalty die) over the course of the hour resting._

_Or bruised and tired he catches his breath in a lull of the battle, before the next onslaught. He currently has 2 penalty dice, a current Grit of 2 from a max Grit of 10. He is only able to grab half an hour, so recovers 1/2 of the potential recovery = 4 points (half of 10-2)_

**Critical Results**

A critical result is triggered when 3+ sixes are rolled on the positive (base + advantage/risk dice) pools. 

  

**On a critical result;**

-   For the winner of an opposed roll;

-   As many net 6s as were rolled are added in additional Flesh damage to the target in addition to normal damage results. This damage can be blocked by defensive harness, and reduced by Critical Failures
-   If at least 1 point of damage is taken to Flesh through armor, the wound it treated as a major Critical Wound. This will trigger a level TN2 Courage test.
-   If the winner also rolls 3+ ones in the negative dice pool (advantage/risk + penalty) then the results are combined, effectively reducing the impact of the Critical Result.
-   Critical results are always considered as solid hits, as if the result of the successes were even.

-   For the loser of an opposed roll;

-   The loser also hits the winner and deals the number of sixes as flesh damage. This damage is reduced by defensive harness and is net of any Critical Failure results.
-   If any Flesh damage is dealt, the wound is considered a Critical Wound and a courage test is required.

**Critical Wounds**

When achieving a critical hit in combat, read the positive combat dice pool of the **loser** to determine the additional impact of the hit.

Whichever number has the most results other than the 6s is the critical effect, and the lowest number of results rolled indicates the location.

_E.g. The winner of the combat has rolled 8 dice + 2R dice with the following results;  6, 6, 5, 5, 3, 2, 1, 1 + 6, 2, 2 >> achieving 6 successes with 3 sixes indicating a critical effect. The largest number of a number after the sizes are twos, and the least number rolled is three. **Two** is the resulting critical wound effect, and **Three** indicates the location._

_In this examples is a  complication to a lower body wound_

  

Number | Highest # =Effect

----------------|--------------------

|6 | Minor scarring,

|5 | Minor break, additional 1P until recovered

|4 | Complication, requires an infection check at +2 

|3 | Major cut or piercing + 1 bleeding, leading to distinct scaring

|2 | Deep cut leading to additional bleeding +2 bleed and distinct scar

|1 | Major break, with longer recovery & narrative limitations - depending on location

  

-   First Aid - stopping bleeding & 50% value for more specific healing
-   Leechcraft - treating humours, sewing wounds, blood letting and treating sickness
-   Surgery - sewing wounds, broken bones and amputations
-   Herbalism - sickness, illness, infection 
-   Medicine - understanding sickness beyond the obvious symptoms, knowing how the body works and theoretical treatments.

  

  

**Fighting Multiple Opponents**

When fighting multiple opponents the dice pool can be split between opponents

  

-   Split pool or leave one unopposed - min split of base dice = 1/3rd to avoid being unopposed
-   Unopposed attacker = +2D 
-   Current penalty is  divided as close to evenly as possible
-   ?resolving momentum = based on winners or A sequence is effective tie with multiple winners

**Defensive Options**

A number of options to improve the chances of surviving a combat, at a cost to offensive capabilities.

**Fight Defensively**

Use skill to focus on not taking Flesh damage. A defender can choose to allocate some or all of their base dice from a skill to be defensive rather than offensive, this equates to attempting to block Flesh damage rather than win the engagement. 

_E.g. a wounded man is defending himself against an assailant. He switch all of his base dice into defensive dice to protect himself from another Flesh wound._

_Defender P1, A2 with a remaining Grit 4 and a 2 pt flesh wound from Flesh 6_

_Defender has Strike 5, as well as D2 from his heavy cloak and tunic, and 1 penalty_

_Attacker has Sword 6 + 2R_

_The ground is muddy and both suffer additional 2 penalties_

_Attacker rolls; net 2 successes (an even number of successes leading to a full blow, the Sword will count as 3F)_

_Defender rolls; net 3 successful defense rolls (7D with 3P)_

_Attacker's net successes reduce the defender's Grit by 2, and the sword's 3F is fully blocked by the 3D successes._

Advantages can only be use offensively, unless specifically stated. If advantage risk dice are rolled they can contribute to reducing the net success level. It is possible that the offensive risk dice rolled can win the outcome and deliver damage.

When fighting multiple opponents, dice are allocated  against a specific attacker, unlike physical armour which is applied to all attacks. 

Dice rolled on defense don't contribute to Critical Success or Failures.

**Evade**

Use a different non weapon agility skill to avoid wounds rather than fight with a weapon it is possible to try to evade an oncoming attack.

-   Roll normal opposed roll using the Evade skill

-   plus 2B for having momentum
-   plus defender's A if attempting to flee

-   If the defender's successes are greater than the attackers successes, it will be possible for the defender to dis-engage
-   Each successful evade = an additional armour dice for damage reduction
-   The defender can add their evade successes to the attackers for the purposes of determining a full or glancing blow (odd or even outcome)

_E.g. Defender attempts to evade a cleaving blow from an attacker with a pole-axe._

_Defender P1, A3 with basic evade of 5 and D4 and momentum_

_Attacker with Strike skill of 6 + 2R + 2 Military Life as Risk dice_

_Neither side has existing penalties_

_Attacker rolls; 4 successes from 6 + 4R rolled_

_Defender rolls; 3 successes from 7B + 1 defensive success from D6 rolled_

_The defender counts their successes with the attackers to make the result odd, and cause a glancing blow_

_Attackers net successes of 1 added with the 4 pts from the pole-axe reduces the defender's Grit to zero with 3 pts carrying 1 point over to Flesh, which is blocked by the defensive successes._

**Actively Blocking**

Use things to block blows to avoid taking damage. Similar to fighting defensively, the emphasis is on avoiding taking damage, but blocked blows can also block Grit damage as well as Flesh damage.

-   Add in base Physical attribute plus the defensive dice for the size and strength of the weapon, shield or items being used to block.
-   Forego any offensive roll, and roll only defensive dice (and penalty dice)
-   It is not possible to get a critical result on defensive dice rolls.
-   If the total successes + flesh damage is equal or greater than the defensive item/weapon value the items is knocked from the defender's hands or smashed.
-   The results of the defensive dice are applied to block any flesh damage 1st and then applied to block Grit.

  

Defensive values;

-   3X normal damage value
-   Improvised defensive objects' have a value based on the material they are made of and their size
-   Shields are 3X their defensive blocking value when actively blocking

  

Item | Blocking Value

Dagger/Small Weapon| 3D

Cudgel/Short Sword | 6D

Sear/Sword/Axe | 9D

Poleaxe|12D

Buckler/Small Shield | 6D

Medium Shield | 12D

Large Shield | 15D

Candlestick| 3D

Log/Stave/Pitchfork | 6D

Chair | 6D

Chest/Barrel | 9D

  

_E.g. a desperate man grabs a chair to attempt to block blows from an attacker._

_Defender P2, A1 with a chair (6D)_ 

_Attacker Strike 5 + 2R + 1P with an axe_

_Attacker rolls net 2 success, expecting to deliver 2 Grit + 3 Flesh. Since he rolled a '1' for a risk result he takes 1 point of Grit damage._

_The net successes is equal and not greater than the defenders P attribute, so he is shaken but not knocked down._

_Defender is lucky and rolls 4 successes from 8 dice to block the axe cleanly on the chair, saving himself from a Flesh wound and blocking 1 point of Grit with the last point of defense._ 

_A chunk flies from the chair but it is still in the defender's hand and usable in a future round._

  

[TODO] - Advantage = bring shield into the fight while attacking = 2X?

**Hiding in Terrain**

hit location? = additional random on top of the roll which doesn't seem quite right...

Additional defensive dice?

**Ranged Attacks**

Ranged combat is resolved by using a form of opposed test that tests the attackers positive dice with penalty dice based on the challenge of the shot against the defenders evasive pool (if any).

If the defender is not aware that they are a target or don't have an option to take evasive action, they will not get a defense pool. The test is still considered opposed and the attacker is only hampered by the situational modifiers.

-   If the target is an inanimate object or unaware of the attacker's shot, the test is effectively an unopposed roll
-   If the target is aware, active and not full engaged with something else, they can oppose the roll with their Evade

**Sequence;**

Establish if the defender is aware or has the ability to evade or take cover.

-   The opposed pools are generally not symmetrically sized
-   The attackers pool is created as normal including all situational modifiers for ranged combat

_E.g._ 

_Attacker is at mid range with a Bow skill of 7D + 2R for Called Shot_

_Plus 2D for Military Life Training_

_Minus 4P for range, 2P for wind and 2P for moving target and 2P for crouching target_

_Pools: 7D 4R 10P >> rolling 5 successes and -3 penalty successes for a net 2_

-   The defenders pool is based on Evade + advantages + penalties + any situational modifiers

_E.g._ 

_Defenders has Evade of 4D_

_Plus 2P for muddy footing and 1P for penalty/stress_

_Adopted a shielded positioned 4 armour, in addition to the 8 armour points_

_Pools: 4D 0R 3P and 12A >> 0 successes with -2 from penalties and 4 blocking_

Taking cover can use hit location to help resolve

**Ranged attack specific situational modifiers;**

Situation | 0 | 2P | 4P | 6P | 8P 

--|--|--|--|--|--

Range| PB |Close| Mid | Long| Far

Visibility| Clear | Mist/Glare | Rain/Dusk | Fog/Near Dark| Dark

# Gunfights
# Firefights

# Firearms

## Weapons
- Strength & Accuracy
- Load-out/calibre

## Effective Range

## Fire Rates

### Single Shot & Load
- Slow loading weapons can take 1 turn to load

### Single Round Fire
- 

### Automatic Fire
- Roll additional Drama Dice representing the effect of the extra shots
- Two successes in the Drama pool equal a second wound, which causes the full Flesh damage of the shot, less any defensive armor saves. This would mean the defender rolling additionally for their armor against this shot. No additional damage is done as a result of successes through Grit for the subsequent hit.
- Two '1s' in the Drama pool indicates a jam, out of ammo or mis-fire

| Auto Fire | Additional Dice | Extra Phy required |
| :--- | :--- |:----|
| Semi Auto Fire | +2 Dd | +1 Phy |
| Full Auto Fire | +4 Dd | +2 Phy |


### Ammo Use
- Option: track specific ammo use -> useful for limited situations 
- Where ammo tracking isn't dramatic, recommend you assume that reloading is covered within a round.
- If an out of ammo result is rolled for automatic weapon fire, then it requires a round to reload.

## Shotguns
- Effect of range

## Explosives
- Knock down checks
	- Additional damage
	- Deafness
- Range considerations
- Protection from blast based on position

## Suppression
- Dice pattern in the general positive dice pool (Bd) to trigger suppression in the target
| Auto Fire | Pattern | Suppression Effects |
| :--- | :--- |:----|
| Semi Auto Fire | Quad | 2Rd |
| Full Auto Fire | Trip | 4Rd |
- Effects of suppression -> Additions of Rd on ==subsequent round
- Use of a Drama Point in the subsequent round allows the suppression to be ignored

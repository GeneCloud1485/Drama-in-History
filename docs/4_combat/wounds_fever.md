# Optional Rules for Wounds and Fever

## **Optional Location of Wounds**

Based on the largest numbers of results of the dice in the positive dice pool, other than 6s. Use of hit location is optional for regular hits, it adds color and drama but not mechanical benefit.

|Number | Location|
| :--- | :--- |
| 5 | Head |
| 4 | Upper torso/Chest |
|3 | Arms |
| 2 | Lower torso/Gut |
| 1 | Legs |

_E.g the attacker achieves 3 successes from 5 base dice and 2 risk advantage dice. Results; 6, 5, 3, 3, 1 and 5, 3 = there are 3 three results so that determines the location. The blow lands on the defender's lower torso_

_[TBD] courage and trait tests are all Risk dice?_

## **Ongoing Bleeding Wounds**

Any wound of 3+ points of Flesh damage will bleed and continue to bleed unless treated. The bleeding value is equal to the wound value + any critical hit modifiers. Bleeding happens on a ~5 minute cycle, additional damage being endured if bleeding is not staunched.

[TBD = minutes & moments… combat is a moment, bleeding is in minutes]

> 5 minutes / Flesh damage is the bleeding out cycle

### **Staunching Wounds**

Each bleeding wound can be staunched by achieving equal or more successes than the wound level using First Aid. This is a cumulative process until wound's bleed value is met, otherwise the wound still counts as bleeding. Only one wound can be treated per 5 minutes by one person.

_E.g. a 3 point wound requires 3 levels of First Aid successes to staunch it._ 

When the cumulative success of First Aid has met the bleed value, the wound is staunched and in normal circumstance won't cause further damage.

### **Continued Bleeding**

Each ~5 minutes a bleeding wounds requires the wounded to take a test of their (max) Flesh pool to avoid further bleeding. 

-   The TNS is the current bleed value for the wound. 
-   Meeting or exceeding the TNS means no further damage is taken from the wound. 
-   Falling short of the TNS adds an additional point of Flesh damage to that wound. This can undo existing healing, or increase the wound level making recovery time longer.
-   A critical success will reduce the bleed value by 1

_E.g. A man-at-arms F7 is hit by a crossbow bolt for 5 points of Flesh damage which is enough to be classified as a major wound, as well as knock him to the ground._

_The blow forces a TNS2 courage test which is failed, and the combined force of the blow and pain knocks the man to the ground unconscious._

_The wound is bleeding badly, but a friend sees him fall and rushes to staunch the wound. Applying a linen compress to the wound (+2R advantage dice), the friend rolls First Aid and gets 2 successes against the cumulative target of 5. This starts to slow the bleeding but doesn't stop it completely. This process takes ~5 minutes._

_After 5 minutes of help the wounded man tests his Flesh pool to avoid suffering further damage. He fails to get any additional successes and loses another point of Flesh raising the bleed value back up to 4_

_The friend continues to staunch the wound, attempting First Aid again, getting 2 more successes to further slow the bleeding to bleed value 2._

_The wounded man must make another Flesh pool test to avoid more bleed damage. He rolls 2 success which is enough to avoid taking more damage, which allows his friend to finish staunching the wound._

_If the friend had not rushed to aid the wounded man, he would have needed to pass 5 TNS1 P checks to stop the bleeding. Any failures would have added to his already low Flesh level. For example, if he had failed 3 checks before achieving 5 success he would have lost 3 most Flesh and be down to -1. This wound would leave a long term persistent problem and added 4 more weeks recovery time._

Any significant physical action runs the risk of opening the wound and starting the bleeding process again.

## **Unconscious & Dying**

Flesh levels;
* At 0 = unconscious
* At -1 = major persistent injury, +4 weeks recovery time
* At -2 = dying with little chance of recovery, need major and successful medical attention + 8 weeks recovery
* At -3 = **death**

_E.g. Having taken a couple of solid hits and having passed level 1 courage tests, the loser is then hit once more reducing their Flesh to 0. They fall unconscious to the ground, bleeding from their wounds. They must pass an additional level 1 Physical check after 5 minutes to see if the bleeding stops._

# **Recovering & Healing**

_Design Goal: Create opportunities to apply wider range of skills, encourage empathy & care, and generate colorful dramatic outcomes which can persist. At a risk of additional complexity_

Even small wounds represent a risk of infection or sickness leading to lasting damage and consequences. Any bleeding wound has a chance of infection and requires time to heal and recovery. After the immediate risk of bleeding has been staunched the healing process will start after the risk of fever and infection has been overcome.

After the immediate risk of death and bleeding from a wound is completed, and in a recovery 'scene' test to see how long the infection & fever will last. Each day the fever lasts creates a need for care, the application of medical skills and a risk of consequences.

Each wound that caused Flesh damage is tracked separately. The size of the wound determines the difficulty in healing, the risk of infection and the recovery time. For simplicity focus on the largest wound received and only bleeding wounds are at risk of infection.

## **Fever & Infection**

The initial recovery time and duration of the fever is a test of Flesh vs TNS of the largest Flesh wound taken, modified by the situation and the care applied. The test is made after ~12 hours or/plus the following morning.

-   TNS is set by the largest wound + 2
-   Flesh pool + situational benefits
-   Care & treatment applied during the ~12 hours
-   With penalties for situational conditions
-   Environment (how far from the best conditions is the situation?)
-   Levels of success of the roll indicates the duration of the fever period;
-   Equal or greater than TNS = fever breaks, no further rolls required
-   1 less = fever for another day
-   2 less = fever for another 3 days & check for infection/sickness on odd
-   3 or more less than the TNS = fever for another 1 week & immediate sickness result (this will cover a critical failure)

_E.g. Our man-at-arms having taken a 5pt wound from a crossbow bolt. His wound has been staunched and he is recovering after the skirmish at a nearby church._

_After the adrenaline of the battle is over, fever starts to take hold. The man-at-arms' friend is still with him and has been able to ensure that he is comfortable, and persuades the local priest to help out._

_The Priest cares for the man throughout the night, and then rolls his leechcraft 4 + 2R for a mixture of honey & feverfrew he has prepared + 2R for his strong religious faith (Religion 6). The resulting 3 successes contribute to the healing of the man-at-arms. Unfortunately for the Priest he picked up a penalty die from over praying..._

_The man-at-arms has a base pool of 7 from his Flesh 7, rolling 2 successes_

_The church is clean, dry and out of the elements. He is being cared for and only picks up 2 penalty dice for having been moved today. He rolls 0 penalties._

_The total result is 5 successes vs the 7 TNS, -2 level of success which indicates his fever will last at least for another 3 days and he risks further infection or sickness during that time._

After a period of fever another check is required to see if the fever has subsided. The TNS is lowered by 1 for each subsequent test of fever. Situational modifiers apply if they have been applied for the majority of the period of fever.

_E.g. After 3 days the man-at-arms must test again to see if the fever subsides. The TNS is 4 one lower than his initial check. The Priest and his friend have been caring for him throughout the time, and can provide assistance._

_The Priest decides to bleed the man-at-arms to reduce the 'hot moist' humors of the fever, and rolls 2 successes. The man-at-arms rolls and also gets 2 successes._

_The result matches the TNS and the man's fever breaks and he will start his full recovery the following day._ 

# **Sickness & Infection**

_Design goal: to create lasting color and memories of encounters, not to create a death spiral or punishment._

When a test of calls for a sickness check, review the results of the Flesh pool. Reading the pool, width determines the result 1-6, and even/odd of number of successes to determine the A/B outcome. The consequence adds +1 to the trait or MF.

| Reading | Symptom | Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 6 | Visions | fevered dreams - gain a religious or greedy & selfish trait|
| 5 | Melancholic | cold & dry, black bile - gain a humble or indulgent traits | 
| 4 | Choleric | hot & dry, yellow bile - gain a courageous or cruel traits, lose 1 Grit from max |
| 3 | Phlegmatic | cold & moist, phlegm - gain a shrewd or cowardly traits, lose 1 Composure from max| 
| 2 | Sanguine | hot & moist, blood - gain a generous or rash traits, lose 1 Flesh from max |
| 1 | Terrors | Mortal Fear - gain a death or disease scar, lose 1 Fort from max |

As well as the impact on the trait, the period of recovery is extended by +1 month.

Recovery from a wound is calculated in terms of weeks of recovery. Each point of damage is reduced by 1 point after taking the current damage in weeks of rest.

-   E.g. a 3 point wound takes 3 weeks to be reduced to a 2 point wound. The would will require another 2 weeks to reduce it to a 1 point wound.
-   4 points wounds will take 10 weeks to fully heal
-   3 points wounds take 6 weeks
-   2 point wounds take 3 weeks
-   1 point takes 1 week

Critical wound recovery is extended by 4 weeks recovery time

[[TBD]] With an infection Grit always have 1 Pen, and Grit can’t be more than 50%



# **Critical Wounds**

When achieving a critical hit in combat, read the positive combat dice pool of the **loser** to determine the additional impact of the hit.

Whichever number has the most results other than the 6s is the critical effect, and the lowest number of results rolled indicates the location.

_E.g. The winner of the combat has rolled 8 dice + 2R dice with the following results;  6, 6, 5, 5, 3, 2, 1, 1 + 6, 2, 2 >> achieving 6 successes with 3 sixes indicating a critical effect. The largest number of a number after the sizes are twos, and the least number rolled is three. **Two** is the resulting critical wound effect, and **Three** indicates the location._

_In this examples is a  complication to a lower body wound_


| Number | Highest # =Effect |
|:--- | :--- |
|6 | Minor scarring
|5 | Minor break, additional 1P until recovered
|4 | Complication, requires an infection check at +2 
|3 | Major cut or piercing + 1 bleeding, leading to distinct scaring
|2 | Deep cut leading to additional bleeding +2 bleed and distinct scar
|1 | Major break, with longer recovery & narrative limitations - depending on location

-   First Aid - stopping bleeding & 50% value for more specific healing
-   Leechcraft - treating humours, sewing wounds, blood letting and treating sickness
-   Surgery - sewing wounds, broken bones and amputations
-   Herbalism - sickness, illness, infection 
-   Medicine - understanding sickness beyond the obvious symptoms, knowing how the body works and theoretical treatments.
- Midwifery
